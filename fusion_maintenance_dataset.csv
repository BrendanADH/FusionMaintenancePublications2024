The safety hazards associated with the DCLL concept as a reactor blanket have been examined in several US design studies. These studies identify the largest radiological hazards as those associated with the dust generation by plasma erosion of plasma blanket module first walls, oxidation of blanket structures at high temperature in air or steam, inventories of tritium bred in or permeating through the ferritic steel structures of the blanket module and blanket support systems, and the 210Po and 203Hg produced in the PbLi breeder/coolant. What these studies lack is the scrutiny associated with a licensing review of the DCLL concept. An insight into this process was gained during the US participation in the ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) Program. In this paper we discuss the lessons learned during this activity and make safety proposals for the design of a Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (FNSF) or a DEMO that employs a lead lithium breeding blanket. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",OVER,DEMO ITER,BLANKET,2014,Blanket; DCLL; DEMO; Fusion; PbLi; Safety,Accident prevention; Breeding blankets; Fusion reactions; Hazards; Blanket; Blanket structures; DCLL; DEMO; Dual-coolant lead-lithium; PbLi; Radiological hazard; Test blanket module; Structural design,"Office of Fusion Energy Science; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC07-05ID14517)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905968575

This paper presents a method to identify and locate the fragments semi-automatically by using the computer vision. The use of computer vision in identification and location faces some difficult challenges such as shadows, poor contrast, low illumination level, less texture and so on. The method developed in this paper enables credible identification of objects with shadows through invariant image and edge detection. The proposed algorithms are validated through our ASIPP robotics and computer vision platform (ARVP).

However, with the increasing involvement of software in the development, the role of Software Configuration Management (SCM) systems have become equally important. The SCM systems can be useful to meet the higher demands on Safety Engineering (SE), Quality Assurance (QA), Validation and Verification (V&V) and Requirements Management (RM) of the developed software tools. In an experimental environment, such as ITER, the new remote handling requirements emerge frequently. This means the development of new tools or the modification of existing tools and the development of new remote handling procedures or the modification of existing remote handling procedures. PLM and SCM systems together can be of great advantage in the development and maintenance of such remote handling system. In this paper, we discuss how PLM and SCM systems can be integrated together and play their role during the development and maintenance of ITER remote handling system. We discuss the possibility to investigate such setup at DTP2 (Divertor Test Platform 2), which is the full scale mock-up facility to verify the ITER divertor remote handling and maintenance concepts. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Robot machine is a promising option for these tasks, but great chatter (machine vibration) would happen in the machining process. The chatter vibration will deteriorate the robot accuracy and surface quality, and even cause some damages on the end-effector tools and the robot structure itself. This paper introduces two vibration control methods, one is passive and another is active vibration control. For the passive vibration control, a parallel mechanism is presented to increase the stiffness of robot machine; for the active vibration control, a hybrid control method combining feedforward controller and nonlinear feedback controller is introduced for chatter suppression. A dynamic model and its chatter vibration phenomena of a hybrid robot is demonstrated. Simulation results are given based on the proposed hybrid robot machine which is developed for the ITER VV assembly and maintenance. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2014,ITER; Parallel robot; Vacuum vessel; Vibration control,Industrial robots; Machining; Maintenance; Mechanisms; Speed control; Active vibration controls; Feed-forward controllers; ITER; ITER vacuum vessels; Nonlinear feedback controllers; Parallel robots; Passive vibration control; Vacuum vessel; Vibration control,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905988980

A major objective of the ITER project is to demonstrate that a future power producing fusion device can be maintained effectively and offer practical levels of plant availability. During its operational lifetime, many systems of the ITER machine will require maintenance and modification; this can be achieved using remote handling methods. The need for timely, safe and effective remote operations on a machine as complex as ITER and within one of the world's most hostile remote handling environments represents a major challenge at every level of the ITER Project organization, engineering and technology. The basic principles of fusion reactor maintenance are presented. An updated description of the ITER remote maintenance system is provided. This includes the maintenance equipment used inside the vacuum vessel, inside the hot cell and the hot cell itself. The correlation between the functions of the remote handling equipment, of the hot cell and of the radwaste processing system is also described.

The Multi-Purpose Deployer (MPD), a redundant and heavy robot for remote handling (RH), is used to repair and monitor the device. For a redundant robot doing maintenance in complicated surroundings, the accurate and efficient Inverse Kinematics (IK) calculating is necessary for the motion control. In this paper, a new method that uses a Dynamic Accuracy Ant Colony Optimization (DAACO) solving redundant IK of MPD is developed. The result shows that this method has an excellent performance in kinematics to control the MPD to complete the RH task in future fusion engineering construction. © 2020",HARD,CFETR,IN-VESSEL,2020,Ant colony optimization (ACO); Inverse kinematics (IK); Multi-Purpose Deployer (MPD),Artificial intelligence; Inverse kinematics; Inverse problems; Materials handling; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Dynamic accuracies; Fusion Engineering; Multi-purpose; Redundant robot; Remote handling; Superconducting tokamak; Ant colony optimization,"CFETR, (2017YFE0300503); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080980034

The current European multi module segment (MMS) blanket concept favours a less invasive small port entry maintenance system over large sector transport concepts, because of the reduced impact on other tokamak systems - particularly the magnetic coils. This paper presents a novel conceptual remote maintenance strategy for a Vertical Maintenance Scheme DEMO, incorporating substantiated designs for an in-vessel mover, to detach and attach the blanket segments, and cask-housed vertical maintenance devices to open and close access ports, cut and join service connections, and extract blanket segments from the vessel. In addition, a conceptual architectural model for DEMO was generated to capture functional and spatial interfaces between the remote maintenance equipment and other systems. Areas of further study are identified in order to comprehensively establish the feasibility of the proposed maintenance system. © 2014 EURATOM/CCFE Fusion Association.",STRAT,DEMO,BLANKET,2014,DEMO; MMS; Remote handling; Vertical Maintenance System,Magnetoplasma; Materials handling; Remote control; Architectural modeling; DEMO; Maintenance schemes; Maintenance systems; MMS; Plasma-facing components; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Maintenance,"European Communities; RCUK Energy Programme, (EP/I501045); Culham Centre for Fusion Energy; H2020 Euratom, EURATOM; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905976875

The cask and plug remote handling system (CPRHS) has been adopted as the solution to provide this nuclear confinement and transportation. This paper discusses the development of the conceptual design to-date and presents the processes being implemented to effectively control the subsequent CPRHS development. The CPRHS is a complex suite of systems with a significant number of interfaces with other ITER systems. Significant effort is being made to ensure that the system requirements are comprehensively defined and carefully managed and a feasible solution is developed - including planned and rescue operations. With the CPRHS performing a critical confinement function appropriate processes are being put in place to control the system development of the CPRHS. The expectation is that the combination of these factors will have a significant impact on the successful implementation of the CPRHS. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.,HARD,ITER,BLANKET DIVERTOR TRANSPORT IN-VESSEL NBI,2014,Cask and plug remote handling system; Fusion for energy; ITER; Maintenance; Remote handling,Conceptual design; Maintenance; Materials handling equipment; Remote control; Feasible solution; In-vessel components; ITER; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Remote maintenance system; System development; System requirements; Materials handling,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905977048

Because of erosion with hazardous and/or activated dust (beryllium, carbon, tungsten) and tritium, the use of remote handling techniques will be eventually required. In particular, the replacement of components such as divertor modules will require the use of remote cutting, welding and inspection of cooling pipes. CFETR consists of 44 divertor (tow sizes) cassettes located in the bottom region of the vacuum vessel. The cassettes will be withdrawn from the vessel through four dedicated ports and transported to a hot cell for refurbishment and replacement during the reactor's operational lifetime. The divertor system remote replacement is one of the key maintenance operations for the CFETR due to the requirements of duty factor (0.3-0.5), machine safety, high plant availability and reliability. The critical issues such as the operational conditions (temperature, atmosphere, radiation, and contamination), maintenance functions, and mechanical design requirements of the divertor remote handling maintenance system (RHMS) are described. The concept design of the remote handling equipment, the operating procedures and the maintenance time estimations for high plant availability are also discussed in this paper. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The elastic deformations due to gravity and dynamical forces, however, will cause a big trajectory tracking error to the robot end. Therefore, the error prediction and compensation strategy should always be studied in advance to achieve a high required accuracy. This paper presents a mathematical method to estimate the static stiffness of EAST articulated maintenance arm (EAMA) robot. Firstly, the stiffness matrix of the modular parallelogram mechanism of robot is obtained based on the Matrix Structural Analysis (MSA) method. Considering the real constraint conditions of robot arms, the matrix is further simplified to a final version with minimum dimension to improve the computational efficiency. Secondly, the simulation examples have been given to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the stiffness equations. And finally, the results show that the presented approach has an acceptable prediction error (less than 5%), which can be applied to other similar robotic systems with long-reach complex links. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,EAST,IN-VESSEL,2017,Articulated maintenance arm; EAST; Error prediction; Matrix structural analysis; Stiffness modeling,Computational efficiency; Error compensation; Errors; Forecasting; Maintenance; Mechanisms; Robots; Stiffness; Structural analysis; Articulated maintenance arm; Compensation strategy; EAST; Error prediction; Parallelogram mechanisms; Stiffness equations; Stiffness model; Trajectory tracking errors; Stiffness matrix,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019873018

The Enhanced Performance 2 shutdown 2010-2011 for example, required the replacement of many thousands of components ranging from about 100 g to 130 kg in weight. The scale of this type of operation and the necessity to maximise operational availability intensified the demands for high productivity whilst maintaining the necessary high standards for precision, reliability, cleanliness, and operational security. This paper discusses the developments in design, control, maintenance, preparation and operation of the current state of the art remote handling facilities at JET. It explores how the experience of over 20,000 h of operations has developed the applied methodology and how this could be appropriate to ITER and other facilities requiring complex remote maintenance, where extensive, high productivity remote handling operations will be essential. It also discusses the advances that have been made in management and presentation of operational data within the command, control and human machine interfaces (HMI) systems, along with the supporting operational databases. © 2012 A.

The EAMA system design is based on a similar articulated inspection arm robot successfully demonstrated in Tore Supra in 2008. In order to better meet EAST configurations and maintenance requirements, optimized mechanisms and dimensions are considered for EAMA robot as upgrades. Besides, the segmented arm is equipped with a 3-DOF wrist end effector and gripper for gripping operation as well as inspection. Some calculations and simulations on statics, kinematics and workspace of EAMA have been presented to validate the feasibility.

During the Engineering Design Activity (EDA), the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (then called as Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute) had been fabricated the prototype of the vehicle manipulator system for the blanket remote handling and confirmed feasibility of this system including automatic positioning of the blanket and rail deployment procedure of the articulated rail. The ITER agreement, which entered into force in the last year, formally decided that Japan will procure the blanket remote handling system and the JAEA, as the Japanese Domestic Agency, is continuing several R&Ds so that the system can be procured smoothly. The residual key issues after the EDA are rail connection and cable handling. The mock-ups of the rail connection mechanism and the cable handling system were fabricated from the last year and installed at the JAEA Naka Site in this March. The former was composed of the rail connecting mechanism, two rail segments and their handling systems. The latter one utilized a slip ring, which implemented 80 lines for power and 208 lines for signal, because there is an electrical contact between the rotating spool and the fixed base. The basic function of these systems was confirmed through the mock-up test. The rail connection mechanism, for example, could accept misalignment of 1.5-2 mm at least. The future test plan is also mentioned in the paper. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The use of virtual technologies is of special interest in the development of the ITER maintenance devices, mainly due to the large costs, sizes and complexity of physical prototypes. This paper shows how virtual prototypes are built and implemented in simulation tools, which are then used to develop the design of the maintenance equipment. Two applications are presented. The first case concerns the controllability of the water-hydraulics servo-actuators of the cassette mover. In the second application, a bilateral teleoperation architecture is designed to remotely control a robot manipulator.

The developed IC allows to read-out, condition and digitize multiple low bandwidth (<10 kHz) sensors. In addition the IC is able to multiplex the digitized sensor signals. To comply with ITER-relevant constraints an adapted radiation qualification procedure has been proposed. The radiation-qualification procedure describes the test criteria and test conditions of the developed ASICs, which are also compared with COTS alternatives, to meet the stringent qualification procedures for electronics exposed to radiation in ITER. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,(general/none),2015,Delta sigma ADC; Instrumentation link; Multiplexer; Qualification; Radiation hard electronics,Actuators; Application specific integrated circuits; CMOS integrated circuits; Delta-sigma ADC; Instrumentation link; Multiplexer; Qualification; Radiation hard; Analog to digital conversion,,Elsevier Ltd,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942816071

In order to design the motion controller of parallel robot, the kinematics analysis of parallel robot was carried out. After that, the dynamic modeling of the hydraulic system was built. As the large variation of heavy payload on MFMP and highly nonlinearity of the system, A Fuzzy-PID controller was built for self-tuning PID controller parameters by using Fuzzy system to achieve better performance.

Neutronic calculations are required to calculate the effects of the JET remote handling (RH) system on the neutron monitors. We developed a simplified geometrical computational model of the JET remote handling system in MCNP. In parallel we developed a script that translates the RH movement data to transformations of individual geometrical parts of the RH model in MCNP. After that a benchmarking of the model was performed to verify and validate the accordance of the target positions of source and RH system with the ones from our model. In the last phase we placed the JET RH system in the simplified MCNP model of the JET tokamak and studied its effect on neutron monitor response for some example source positions and boom configurations. As the correction factors due to presence of the JET RH system can potentially be significant in cases when the boom is blocking a port close to the detector under investigation, we have chosen boom configurations so that this is avoided in the vast majority of the source locations.

The approach is particularly suited to be adopted in real-time human-in-the-loop control strategies involving high-frequency control feedback and requiring safe interaction between the manipulator and the in-vessel environment. The capability of the inverse kinematic method to find a solution for a set of different robot end-effector poses, inside a toroidal environment, was tested on the HyRMan kinematics, i.e. the Hyper Redundant Manipulator developed in the framework of the Divertor Tokamak Test (DTT) project. The simulation tests were aimed at assessing performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy in the end-effector positioning, computational burden, distance from obstacle, distance from joint angles and torque limits and success rate of the task execution. The achieved results were compared to the ones obtained through an iterative method proposed in literature, i.e. the one based on the computation of the Jacobian pseudo-inverse, demonstrating overall higher performance of the proposed approach and comparable ability to safely avoid obstacles and joint limits. © 2022",SOFT,DTT,(general/none),2022,Hyper-Redundant Manipulators; Inverse Kinematics; Nuclear Fusion; Remote Maintenance,End effectors; Inverse kinematics; Inverse problems; Redundant manipulators; Control strategies; Geometric approaches; High frequency HF; Human-in-the-loop control; Hyper-redundant manipulator; Nuclear fusion; Nuclear fusion reactors; Performance; Real- time; Remote maintenance; Iterative methods,"Agenzia Nazionale per le Nuove Tecnologie, l'Energia e lo Sviluppo Economico Sostenibile, ENEA",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85132220375

Operating experience with this type of wall will aid ITER in their design choice for plasma facing components in divertor and plasma heating systems. It is essential that this extensive in-vessel refurbishment be completed in the shortest possible time and this has necessitated the implementation of a significant enhancement of the remote handling system. A new deployment method for RH tools and components has been devised comprising an extension to the articulated Boom, which enters the JET Vessel through the Octant 1 port. In the EP2 shutdown this will transport a multi-drawer task module to the workplace of the MASCOT (the JET servo-manipulator), which itself is deployed by the existing Octant 5 Boom. The new Octant 1 Boom can remotely exchange its task module inside the Octant 1 Boom Facility. This new Boom system will save time by eliminating the need for the existing Octant 5 Boom to frequently move around the torus in order to fetch new tools and components. It also reduces the dependence on manned entries in pressurised suits into the Octant 1 Boom facility to load the tool and component racks. In addition, the very large number of remote handling tasks demanded by the JET EP2 upgrade has required the design and development of an extensive range of new remote handling tools, examples of which will be described. This paper will discuss the design, control and operation of all the new remote handling equipment being developed at JET in preparation of the EP2 shutdown. It will also discuss the advances being implemented in management and presentation of operational data within the command, control and Human Machine Interface (HMI) system. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the updated design of the vehicle manipulator and rail has been carried out because of collision avoidance between modules and vehicle manipulator. According to the updated design, the vehicle manipulator has been reduced by about 30% in weight, compared with the reference design. In parallel with design activities, the R&D to clarify the specifications of the IVT design in detail is also performed, i.e., simulation system to provide the visual information during maintenance, dry lubricant to prevent the lubricant oil from spreading in the vacuum vessel (VV). The rail connection and cable handling in the transfer cask, which are critical issues for IVT system, are under preparation of the demonstration tests to finalize the design of the IVT system. Connection of the rail joint and cable handling test facilities are planned and under fabrication now. These test facility will be installed by the end of March 2008, and the performance tests will be carried out from April 2008. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The (color) imaging capabilities of the RHBD CIS are demonstrated up to 10 MGy (SiO2), 1 Grad (SiO2), validating the radiation hardness of most of the designed integrated circuit. No significant sensitivity (i.e., responsivity and color filter transmittance) or readout noise degradation is observed. The proposed readout chain architecture allows achieving a maximum output voltage swing larger than 1 V at 10 MGy (SiO2). The influence of several pixel layout (the gate oxide thickness, the gate overlap distance, and the use of an in-pixel P+ ring) and manufacturing process parameters (photodiode doping profile and process variation) on the radiation-induced dark current increase is studied. The nature of the dark current draining mechanism used to cancel most of the radiation-induced degradation is also discussed and clarified. © 1963-2012 IEEE.",HARD,ITER,(general/none),2018,Active pixel sensors (APS); CMOS; CMOS image sensors (CISs); Co60; dark current; deep submicrometer (DSM) process; enclosed layout transistors (ELTs); Gigarad (Grad); image sensors; integrated circuit; interface states; ionizing radiation; ITER; MAPS; Megagray (MGy); monolithic active pixel sensor; quantum efficiency; rad hard; radiation damage; radiation effects; radiation hard; radiation hardened by design (RHBD); radiation hardening; radiation tolerant; shallow trench isolation (STI); total ionizing dose (TID); trapped charge; X-rays; γ-rays,CMOS integrated circuits; Dark currents; Digital cameras; Flash memory; Gamma rays; Grading; Hardening; Image processing; Image sensors; Integrated circuits; Interface states; Ionizing radiation; Logic gates; Maps; Materials handling; Photodiodes; Pixels; Quantum efficiency; Quantum theory; Radiation; Radiation damage; Radiation hardening; Remote control; Semiconducting silicon; Silica; Silicon compounds; Transistors; X rays; Active Pixel Sensor; CMOS image sensor; Co60; Deep sub-micron process; Enclosed layout transistor; Gigarad; ITER; Megagray; Monolithic active pixel sensors; Rad hard; Radiation hard; Radiation hardening (electronics); Radiation tolerant; RHBD; Shallow trench isolation; Total Ionizing Dose; Trapped charge; Radiation effects,"Fusion for Energy, F4E, (F4E-OFC-358-2-01-01, F4E-OMF-272-01-18); Fusion for Energy, F4E",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032667147

The success of a tokamak-type fusion reactor will depend to a great extent on developing reliable and safe methods of carrying out routine maintenance and repairs remotely. Remote Handling System (RHS) is used to perform remotely the maintenance inside the vacuum vessel. RHS will be contaminated during exposure inside ITER Vacuum Vessel with activated dust, tritium and beryllium. RHS will be transported to the Hot Cell Facility to be remotely decontaminated before its hands-on maintenance operation. RHS maintenance is made of repair, changing parts, testing and re-commissioning activities. In this paper the results of concept design engineering investigation of the routine remote maintenance and repair is developed. Maintenance requirements for a nuclear fusion facility are rather similar to those of JET (David et al. 2005 [1]), but magnified (Lässer et al., 2012 [2]; Loughlin et al., [3]).

A reference set of representative ITER remote handling maintenance tasks was included the master slave manipulator system (MS2) benchmark product. The benchmark product was used in task performance tests in a representative two-handed dexterous manipulation test bed at NRG. In the setup, the quality of visual feedback was varied by exchanging direct view with indirect view setups in which visual feedback is provided via video cameras. Interaction forces were measured via an integrated force sensor. The impact of feedback quality on the performance of maintenance tasks at the level of handling individual parts was measured and analysed. Remote execution of the maintenance actions took roughly 3-5 times more time than hands-on. Visual feedback was identified as the dominant factor, including aspects like (lack of) operator control over camera placement, pan, tilt and zoom, lack of 3D perception, image quality, and latency.

Since the limitation on inherent strength, load, size, etc, a manipulator robot can only complete very limited tasks. Robotic arm systems for remote operation such as JET and MPD can carry certain tools to complete a variety of operating tasks, but it is difficult to achieve the system which is very complex. Therefore, if the inherent idea of using a single robot to complete the specified functions can change, it is possible to make the problems simpler and easier to solve by adding auxiliary robots working together with the robotic arm systems to complete the assigned tasks. Under the above background, based on the deeply analyzing and refining the functional requirements of the vessel operation robot, proceeding from the perspective of ability to move and carry a certain operating device, this paper presents a wormlike creeping mobile robot walking on the V-shaped circular slot inside a nuclear fusion vessel such as EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak). We have designed and implemented the principle prototype of the robot which has chain structure with n (n ≥2) creeping units. Each creeping unit is of three-part structure, which consists of fore segment, mid segment and back segment connected by bidirectional universal joint. The fore and back segments stretch the paws to contact the surface of V-shaped slot, while the mid segment realizes the overall movement of robot. In order to evaluate the design and implementation of the mobile robot platform, functional analysis is devoted to modules of robot. Especially for the requirements of walking stability on the V-shaped slot, creeping gait planning is analyzed to construct a multi-axis coordinating movement control scheme for creeping motion. Finally, by using the simulated EAST nuclear fusion vessel, the principle prototype is tested, and the preliminary evaluation of its functional index and related technical parameters is carried out. The experimental results show that the principle prototype of the robot can achieve stable walking on the V-shaped circular slot at the bottom of the nuclear fusion vessel, and it has a certain ability to carry equipments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,EAST,IN-VESSEL,2017,Creeping walking mechanism; EAST nuclear fusion vessel; Gait planning; Mechanical property analysis; Movement performance test,Fighter aircraft; Manipulators; Mobile robots; Nuclear energy; Robotic arms; Robotics; Robots; Walking aids; Design and implementations; Experimental advanced superconducting tokamaks; Functional requirement; Gait planning; Movement performance; Nuclear fusion; Remote maintenance system; Walking mechanism; Machine design,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016156733

A preliminary study has been made of remote-handling scenarios of the main components, including blanket, divertor and coils. Frequent scheduled maintenance operations will be carried out without breaking the cryostat vacuum and by working from (shielded) containers connected to maintenance ports external to the cryostat. Exchange of the blanket is foreseen after the initial basic performance phase. This involves application of special welding and cutting techniques that will have to be developed and remotized, as well as handling of modules weighing up to 60 tonnes via complex trajectories inside the vessel and through narrow ports, whilst balancing forces will have to be applied to counteract the out-of-centre-of-gravity lifting. Maintenance scenarios are designed with radiation exposure and contamination control as an overriding requirement. This may require the use of shielded, very heavy containment casks. Following the detailed study of remote handling feasibility, equipment design will proceed up to the end of Engineering Design Activities and beyond. Development will be required for welding, cutting and inspection equipment, and for radiation-hard components, and tests will have to be undertaken to verify particularly difficult operations. © 1995.",OVER,ITER,BLANKET DIVERTOR COILS CRYO TRANSPORT,1995,,Breeding blankets; Containment vessels; Cryostats; Cutting equipment; Electric coils; Experimental reactors; Machine design; Maintenance; Materials handling; Performance; Radiation shielding; Remote control; Contamination control; Divertor; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Radiation exposure; Remote handling; Fusion reactors,"Home Teams; Visiting Home Team Attachments; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, ORNL",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029277168

However, lack of commercial selection of water hydraulic components, common design expertise and known application experiences prevents wide use of water hydraulics. Since 1994, IHA has designed and manufactured water hydraulic tools for ITER divertor maintenance and experiences have been good. Therefore, IHA is developing water hydraulic component selection to be applied in coming systems where water hydraulics is foreseen to provide an advantage. Aim of the still on going project is to develop a set of components like power units, control components and actuators. By that way designers are able to apply water hydraulics where advantageous.

These were constrained by the proposed tokamak architecture and the challenging environments but considered a range of port layouts and handling system designs. The design-driving requirements were to have short maintenance durations and to demonstrate power plant relevant technologies. Work concentrated on the in-vessel maintenance systems, where the design constraints are the most challenging and the potential impact on the plant design is highest. A robust blanket handling system design was not identified during the Pre-Concept Design Phase. Novel enabling technologies were identified and, where these were critical to the maintenance strategy and not being pursued elsewhere, proof-of-principle designs were developed and tested. Technology development focused on pipe joining systems such as laser bore cutting and welding, pipe alignment, and on the control systems for handling massive blankets. Maintenance studies were also conducted on the ex-vessel plant to identify the additional transport volumes required to support the plant layout. The strategic implications of using vessel casks, and of using containment cells with cell casks, was explored. This was motivated by the costs associated with the storage of casks, one of several ex-vessel systems that can drive the overall plant layout.

The efficiency of the remote maintenance operations can be effectively increased by designing specialized remote handling control systems with high precision and accuracy. Huge efforts are needed to equip the RH operators with the advanced technologies that provide the real knowledge and interactions with the operating environment without being physically present. This can be achieved by using virtual reality techniques for tele-presence that may be extremely beneficial for the offline training as well as in assisting during the online RH operations. This paper outlines a concept with prototype experiments for an interactive control system using virtual reality integration and haptic feedback. Virtual 3D models of the complete work-cell have been developed and are updated synchronously for the monitoring and controlling of the robotic equipment. Force reflection servo type control strategy has been employed for the master-slave control. The proposed control system architecture and results from various test cases have been summarized here. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,(none),(general/none),2019,Haptic feedback; Remote handling; Robotics; Virtual reality,Maintenance; Materials handling; Remote control; Robotics; Tokamak devices; Virtual reality; Control system architecture; Force reflection servo type control strategy; Haptic feedbacks; Monitoring and controlling; Operating environment; Prototype experiment; Remote handling; Virtual reality techniques; Feedback,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059233409

The MPD provides the means for deployment and handling of in-vessel tools or components inside the vacuum vessel (VV) for dust and tritium inventory control, in-service inspection, leak localization, and in-vessel diagnostics. It also supports the operation of blanket first wall maintenance and neutral beam duct liner module maintenance operations. This paper describes the concept design of the MPD. The MPD is a cask based system, i.e. it stays in the hot cell building during the machine operation, and is deployed to the VV using the cask system for the in-vessel operations. The main part of the MPD is the articulated transporter which provides transportation and positioning of the in-vessel tools or components. The articulated transporter has nine degrees of freedom with a payload capacity up to 2 tons. The articulated transporter can cover the whole internal surface of the VV by switching between the four equatorial RH ports. Additionally it can use two non-RH equatorial ports to transfer large tools or components. A concept for in-cask tool exchange is developed which minimizes the cask transportation by allowing the MPD to stay in the VV during the tool exchange. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The replacement of the hot breeding blanket (BB), by far the largest in-vessel component, at the end of its lifecycle is particularly important. This includes the removal from the reactor, the transport to the active maintenance facility (AMF) where the BB is decontaminated and prepared for storage as radioactive waste and the preparation and installation of the new BB. Significant effort is made to control and minimize the spread of contamination. All operations are therefore carried out in sealed rooms and corridors. The high mass of the BB segments requires all remote handling equipment to be capable of handling high payloads of more than 100 tons. It must also operate within tight space and based on impaired feedback from control sensors in the radioactive environment. At the same time, it must be highly reliable in accordance with nuclear requirements and be recoverable in case of failure. Some concepts of BB lifting devices were investigated in the past [1] (Keep et al., 2017), but were discontinued due to insufficient payload capacity. Thus, the vertical maintenance of the BB was identified as one of DEMO's key design integration issues since failure to develop a feasible concept would potentially require major changes to the tokamak architecture [2] (Bachmann et al., 2020). A new study had been initiated with a focus on structural integrity and efficient load transfer from the BB through the RH equipment to the VV upper port. A concept of the BB transfer cask and the BB transporter resulting from this study is presented in this article together with a conceptual study of the layout of the tokamak building and the AMF. Studies of alternative concepts for in-vessel maintenance are conducted in parallel but will not be described here. © 2022 The Author(s)",HARD SYS,DEMO ,BLANKET,2022,Demo; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Tokamak,Breeding blankets; Life cycle; Maintenance; Materials handling; Radioactivity; Tokamak devices; Conceptual study; Demo; Handling equipments; In-vessel components; Maintenance concepts; Maintenance facility; Radioactive environment; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Roadmap; Remote control,"H2020 Euratom, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125383458

Remotely performed maintenance actions tend to be more time-costly than actions performed by direct human access. With a human operator in the control loop and adequate situational feedback, a two-armed master slave manipulator system can mimic direct access with dexterous manipulation, tactile feedback and vision. But even then, turnaround times are still very high. Adapting the design for simplified maintenance operations can yield significant time savings. One of the methods known to produce a simpler, more robust design, which is also better suited for handling with robots, is Design For Assembly (DFA). This paper discusses whether and how the principles of DFA can be applied to simplify maintenance operations for ITER. While DFA is normally used with series-production and ITER is a unique product, it is possible to apply the principles of DFA to ITER maintenance operations. Furthermore, DFA's principles can be applied at different abstraction levels. Combining principles of DFA with Virtual Reality leads to new insights and provides additional value. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

FAST remote handling (RH) solutions are provided according to an ""interactive design review"" philosophy based on virtual prototyping techniques. Assuming an ITER configuration as start point, it foresees an iterative process of design review, carried out in virtual reality (VR) environment and oriented to obtain a sort of best solution from the RH point of view.

The tritium breeding blankets will require periodic replacement via the upper vertical ports at the top of the vacuum vessel. This operation will be challenging due to the scale of the blankets (∼10 m tall, and presently assumed to weigh up to 80 t). Concepts have been developed for the blanket replacement process. Analysis of this activity has identified the blanket transporter as a key system, carrying a high technical risk. This will manoeuvre the blanket segments between the mounts and fixations within the vacuum vessel, and a position that allows vertical lifting through the upper port. This paper outlines a conceptual study to develop a feasible design for the blanket transporter. Requirements were obtained via functional analysis and kinematic analysis of the breeder blanket replacement allowing development of concepts for the main kinematic mechanism. Evaluation lead to down-selection of a concept for further development: A Hybrid Kinematic Mechanism with the first three of its degrees of freedom as a parallel mechanism. The proposed concept demonstrates potential for developing and integrating technologies within the blanket transporter to produce an engineering design that can validate the blanket replacement strategy and hence viability of the DEMO concept. © 2017 The Authors",HARD,DEMO,DIVERTOR ,2017,Breeding blankets; DEMO; Manipulator; Remote maintenance,Breeder reactors; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Kinematics; Manipulators; Mechanisms; Risk assessment; DEMO; Integrating technology; Kinematic mechanism; Parallel mechanisms; Remote maintenance; Remote maintenance system; Replacement strategy; Tritium breeding blanket; Breeding blankets,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011958908

VR can also improve the situational awareness of human operators during actual Remote Handling (RH) operations. Until now, VR systems use geometric models of the environment and the objects being handled and kinematic models of the manipulation systems. The addition of dynamic effects into the VR simulation was investigated. Important dynamic effects are forces due to contact transitions and the bending of beams under heavy loads. A novel dynamics simulation module was developed and introduced as an add-on to the VR4Robots VR software. Tests were performed under simplified test conditions and in the context of realistic ITER maintenance tasks on a benchmark product and on the ECRH Upper Port Launcher Plug (UPL). The introduction of dynamic effects into VR simulations was found to add realism and provide new insights in procedure development. The quality of the haptic feedback depends strongly on the haptic device used to ""display"" haptic feedback to the operator.

As part of this programme, a review of the remote maintenance strategy considered maintenance solutions compatible with expected environmental conditions, whilst showing potential for meeting the plant availability targets. A key finding was that, for practical purposes, the expected radiation levels prohibit the use of complex remote handling operations to replace the first wall. In 2012/2013, these remote maintenance activities were further extended, providing an insight into the requirements, constraints and challenges. In particular, the assessment of blanket and divertor maintenance, in light of the expected radiation conditions and availability, has elaborated the need for a very different approach from that of ITER. This activity has produced some very informative virtual reality simulations of the blanket segments and pipe removal that are exceptionally valuable in communicating the complexity and scale of the required operations. Through these simulations, estimates of the maintenance task durations have been possible demonstrating that a full replacement of the blankets within 6 months could be achieved. The design of the first wall, including the need to use sacrificial limiters must still be investigated. In support of the maintenance operations, a first indication of the requirements of an Active Maintenance Facility (AMF) has been elaborated. © 2014 EURATOM CCFE Fusion Association.",OVER,DEMO,BLANKET DIVERTOR,2014,Blanket; DEMO; Divertor; Maintenance; PPP&T; Remote handling,Conceptual design; Materials handling; Remote control; Blanket; DEMO; Divertor; Environmental conditions; Maintenance operations; Remote handling; Technology programmes; Virtual reality simulations; Maintenance,"EFDA, (FU07/CT/2012/00071, FU07/CT/2013/00042); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1); Research Councils UK, RCUK, (EP/I501045)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905990102

Much of the maintenance of ITER will be performed using remote handling methods and some with combined manual and remote activities working together. The organization and management of the ITER remote handling facilities will be of a scale unlike any other remote handling application in the world. The ITER remote handling design and procurement activities will require co-ordination and management across many different sites throughout the world. It will be a major challenge for the ITER project to ensure a consistent quality and technical approach in all of the contributing parties. To address this issue the IO remote handling team are implementing the ITER Maintenance Management Plan (IMMP) comprising an overarching document defining the policies and methodologies (ITER Remote Maintenance Management System or IMMS) and an associated ITER remote handling code of practise (IRHCOP). The IMMS will be in document form available as a pdf file or similar. The IRHCOP will be implemented as a web based application and will provide access to the central resource of the entire code of practise from any location in the world. The IRHCOP data library will be centrally controlled in order that users can be assured of the data relevance and authenticity. This paper will describe the overall approach being taken to deal with this challenge and go on to detail the structure and content of both the IMMS and the IRHCOP. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The maintenance strategy for these components has to ensure system availability after failure or scheduled maintenance. This paper shows how virtual reality (VR) simulation [1] can be used as a tool to analyze the maintenance process, to predict the mean time to repair and to ensure the RH compatibility of one ITER sub-system, the Upper Port Launcher (UPL) [2]. Special emphasis is put on the development of RH procedures and the identification of tooling requirements. The possibility to simulate RH logistics and repair actions in an early stage of the design process allows for the identification of those maintenance actions that require dedicated tests in the Launcher Handling Test Facility at Karlsruhe. The VR analysis, together with dedicated mock-up tests will demonstrate the RH compatibility of the UPL plug, provide input to the design of the Port Plug maintenance area in the ITER Hot Cell, and support the development of RH maintenance tooling. © 2009.",SOFT,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2009,ITER; Launcher; Maintenance; Remote handling; Upper Port Plug; Virtual reality,Experimental reactors; Launching; Maintainability; Materials handling; Remote control; Test facilities; Virtual reality; Design process; Hot Cell; ITER; Launcher; Maintenance Action; Maintenance process; Maintenance strategies; Mean time to repairs; Mockup test; Port plugs; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Scheduled maintenance; Sub-system; Sub-systems; System availability; Upper Port Plug; Repair,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67449085011

To optimize the tritium removal procedure, decontamination experiments using a gas purge with three different moisture concentrations were also performed. The surface tritium concentrations of CeO2 containing alkaline barium glass (NB), CeO2 containing lead glass (LX) and synthetic quartz (Quartz) after the exposure experiments were 7.80, 10.94 and 0.67 Bq/cm2, respectively. It was found that the tritium concentration was influenced by the compositions of the materials. The concentrations of tritium on type 831 (solid lubrication material: graphite) and type 237 (solid lubrication material: tungsten disulfate) dry bearings after the exposure experiments were 89.80 and 31.78 Bq/cm2, respectively. The tritium concentration in an electric cable tested was 5014 Bq/g after HTO moisture exposure. The tritium concentrations of lenses, LX, as typical experimental results, decreased to 2.72, 4.42 and 3.89 Bq/cm2 by purging with the moist air, dry air and dry N2, respectively. The tritium concentrations of dry bearing, type 831 dropped to 6.61, 9.42 and 10.16 Bq/cm2 by the same three decontamination treatments, respectively. A large decontamination factor of 13.6 was achieved in the case of type 831 dry bearing with a moist air purge. The tritium concentration in the electric cable was 3236 Bq/g after a moist air purge, and the decontamination factor was as low as 1.6. Therefore, decontamination with a moist air purge is not so effective for the electric cable. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A complete review has been undertaken of the functional requirements and benefits of VR for remote handling and a subsequent market survey of the present state-of-the-art of VR systems has resulted in the implementation of a new system for JET. The VR system is used in two discrete modes: in on-line mode the remote handling equipment Electro-mechanical hardware is connected to the VR system and provides input for the VR system to update a real time 3-D display of the equipment inside the torus. This mode supplements the video camera system and assists with camera control and warnings of impending or potential collisions. In Off-line mode the operator manipulates the VR system model with no connections to the remote handling equipment. This mode is used during preparation of RH operational strategies, checking of operational feasibility and operations procedures. Various VR systems were evaluated against a detailed technical specification that covered visualisation function and performance, user interface design and base model input/creation capabilities. The cheapest of those systems that satisfied the technical requirements was selected. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The remote maintenance project must provide an understanding of the limits of the strategy and technologies so as to inform the developing plant design of the maintenance constraints. A comprehensive set of maintenance requirements has been produced, in conjunction with the plant designers, against which design options can be assessed. The proposed maintenance solutions are based around a strategy that deploys casks above each of the vertical ports to exchange the blanket segments and at each of the divertor ports to exchange the divertor cassettes. The casks deploy remote handling equipment to open and close the vacuum vessel, remove and re-install pipework, and replace the in-vessel components. A technical design risk assessment has shown that the largest risks are common to all of the proposed solutions and that they are associated with two key issues, first; the ability to handle the large blanket and divertor components to the required positional accuracy with limited viewing and position feedback, and second; to perform rapid and reliable pipe connections, close to the blankets, with demonstrated quality that meets the safety requirements. © 2016",OVER,DEMO,(general/none),2016,Blanket; DEMO; Divertor; Maintenance; Progress; Remote,Design; Fusion reactor divertors; Risk assessment; Blanket; DEMO; Divertor; Progress; Remote; Maintenance,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84950263099

This paper presents the arguments in support of the case for the maintainability of the design, notably if this maintenance is to be performed by advanced remote methods. This structure is compliant to the evolving maintenance strategy of ITER. Initial results of a Failure Mode Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) and a development risk analysis for the ITER upper port plug #3, housing the Charge Exchange Recombination Spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostic, are employed for the definition of the maintenance strategy. The CXRS upper port plug is essentially an optical system which transfers visible light from the plasma into a fiber bundle. The most critical component in this path is the first mirror (M1) whose reflectivity degrades during operation due to deposition and/or erosion dominated effects. Amongst other measures to mitigate these effects, the strategy is to allow for a replacement of this mirror. Therefore it is mounted on a retractable central tube. The main purpose of this tube is to make frequent replacements possible without hindering operation. The maintenance method in terms of time, geometry and spare part policy has a large impact on cost of the system and time usage in the hot cell. Replacement of the tube under vacuum and magnetic field seems infeasible due to the operational risk involved. The preferred solution is to have a spare tube available which is replaced in parallel with other maintenance operations on the vessel, as to avoid any interference in the hot cell with the shutdown scheduling. This avoids having to refurbish a full port plug and also allows for a more frequent replacement of M1, as we can replace the mirror anytime the vacuum vessel is vented, estimated to be once a year. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Its mission is to bridge the gaps between ITER and DEMO, and obtain the fusion energy power in China. However during the plasma operation the in-vessel components, plugs and other components of the CFETR would be influenced and activated by high energy neutrons, polluted by tritium. So the maintenance of these components must be handled in remote ways. First of all, the remote maintenance scheme should be planned to define how to do the maintenance work. Then the classification of the components must be performed to determine which component should be handled by remote ways.

The most critical issue of the vehicle manipulator system is the feasibility of the deployment and storage of the articulated rail, composed of eight rail links without any driving mechanism in the joints. To solve this issue, a new driving mechanism and procedure for the rail deployment and storage has been proposed, taking account of the repeated operation of the multi-rail links deployed and stored in the same kinematical manner. The new driving mechanism, which is different from those of a usual articulated manipulator or 'articulated boom' equipped with actuators in every joint for movement, is composed of three external mechanisms installed outside the articulated rail, i.e. a vehicle traveling mechanism as main driver and two auxiliary driving mechanisms. A simplified synchronized control of three driving mechanisms has also been proposed, including 'torque-limit control' for suppression of the overload of the mechanisms. These proposals have been tested using a full-scale vehicle manipulator system, in order to demonstrate the proof of principle for rail deployment and storage. As a result, the articulated rail has been successfully deployed and stored within 6 h each, less than the target of 8 h, by means of the three external driving mechanisms and the proposed synchronized control. In addition, the overload caused by an unexpected mismatch of the synchronized control of three driving mechanisms has also been successfully suppressed less than the rated torque by the proposed 'torque-limit control'. It is therefore concluded that the feasibility of the rail deployment and storage of the vehicle manipulator system has been demonstrated. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The more the development of tokamak device progresses from an experimental reactor to a commercial reactor, the more important the maintenance issue becomes. The maintenance difficulty of tokamak system is due to its configuration complexity, enormous electromagnetic loads and material radioactivation. In order to mitigate the difficulty, a very low activation material of SiC/SiC composite and a torus configuration with high aspect ratio of eight are introduced. The torus system is radially divided into equal sectors and each sector forms an assembly unit. All the piping and feeder systems are extracted to the spacious torus central region. The new concept is called 'DREAM' tokamak reactor, which stands for DRastically EAsy Maintenance. The maximum toroidal field strength of 20 T and the plasma major and minor radii of 16 m and 2 m lead to high fusion power of 5.5 GW under the moderate physics constraints such as a 'non-reversed shear profile' with the MHD safety factor of 3, Troyon factor of 3 for the beta limit and the energy confinement time enhancement factor of 2. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

The SlimCS, designed in JAEA, adopts the horizontal sector transport hot cell maintenance scheme. In order to determine the most appropriate DEMO reactor maintenance scheme, it is important to assess the various maintenance schemes. In this paper the vertical sector transport maintenance concept is proposed for the first time. In the sector maintenance scheme, the amount of cutting/re-welding of the piping is minimized. The sector including blanket modules and a high-temperature shield was divided into 10° segments in a toroidal direction. The sectors are designed to be removed and re-inserted through upper alternate vertical maintenance ports. In the case of the vertical sector transport maintenance scheme, inter-coil structures could be adopted for use against turnover force in toroidal field (TF) coils.

In this study, three different maintenance schemes are considered based on (1) the number of maintenance ports and (2) the insertion direction. The design study clarifies critical design factors and key engineering issues on the maintenance scheme: (1) how to support an enormous overturning force of the toroidal field coils in the large open port for sector transport and (2) define the transferring mechanism of sectors in the vacuum vessel. On reviewing these assessment factors, the sector transport using a limited number of horizontal maintenance ports is found to be a more realistic maintenance scheme. In addition, evaluating maintenance scenarios under high decay heat is proposed for the first time. The key design factors are the cool-down time in the reactor and the cooling method in the maintenance scheme to keep components under operational temperature. Based on one-dimensional heat conduction analysis, after one month cool-down time, each sector of SlimCS could be transported to the hot cell facility by gas cooling. © 2013 IAEA, Vienna.",STRAT,DEMO,TRANSPORT COILS IN-VESSEL,2013,,Availability; Design; Cooling methods; Critical design; Maintenance scenario; Maintenance schemes; One-dimensional heat; Operational temperature; Plant availability; Toroidal Field coils; Maintenance,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84889034202

The aim of the R&D program performed under the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) work program is to demonstrate the feasibility of close inspection tasks such as viewing or leak testing of the Divertor cassettes and the Vacuum Vessel (VV) first wall of ITER. It is assumed that a long reach, limited payload carrier penetrates the ITER chamber through the openings evenly distributed around the machine such as In-Vessel Viewing System (IVVS) access or through upper port plugs. To perform an intervention a short time after plasma shut down, the operation of the robot should be realised under ITER conditioning i.e. under high vacuum and temperature conditions (120 °C). The feasibility analysis drove the design of the so-called articulated inspection arm (AIA) which is a 8.2 m long robot made of five modules with a 11 actuated joints kinematics. A single module prototype was designed in detail and manufactured to be tested under ITER realistic conditions at CEA-Cadarache test facility. As well as demonstrating the potential for the application of an AIA type device in ITER, this program is also dedicated to explore the necessary robotic technologies required to ITER's IVVS deployment system. This paper presents the whole AIA robot concept, the first results of the test campaign on the prototype vacuum and temperature demonstrator module. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

As a matter of fact, these robots are subject to large deformations, either induced by the geometric configuration of their mechanical structure or by the heavy payloads they usually transport. This work was motivated by the need of deriving physical-based predictive models able to simulate the mechanical behavior of such large robotic mechanisms, while performing dynamic tasks. The method formulates the dynamics of robotic manipulators on a Lie group, and uses a finite element procedure to discretize the flexible bodies. The method is applied to a complex mechanism, the serial/parallel flexible manipulator which has been recently selected for DEMO blanket remote handling. The case studies investigated in this paper involve the simulations of this manipulator while handling the inboard and outboard blanket segments according to the sequence of maneuvers planned for their removal processes from the vessel. The results show that such dynamic simulations could give useful information for design, analysis and control of remote handling equipment. The generality of the method makes this approach prone to be easily used in simulating the dynamics of other flexible manipulators for remote handling of large in-vessel components inside nuclear fusion reactors. © 2018 EUROfusion Consortium",SOFT,DEMO,BLANKET,2019,DEMO; Flexible manipulators; Remote maintenance; Robot dynamics; Tokamak,Flexible manipulators; Fusion reactors; Lie groups; Materials handling; Nuclear energy; Remote control; Robotics; Analysis and controls; DEMO; Finite element procedure; Geometric configurations; Nuclear fusion reactors; Remote maintenance; Robot dynamics; Tokamak; Dynamics,"Euratom research and training program 2014-2018, (EEG-2015/21); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059196417

The BL has to be maintained by remote handling means due to high radiation levels in the VV after D-T operation. The remote handling (RH) equipment for BL maintenance consists of articulated rail, supports, a rail-mounted vehicle, a telescopic arm, an end-effecter, tools and related systems such as transfer casks and umbilical system. Towards the construction, the BL RH equipment design has been improved and developed in more detail, based on the 2001 FDR design. The overview of design results is introduced in this paper. The design of rail deployment system of the BL RH has been updated to enable the rail connection in the transfer cask in order to minimize occupation space at storage area. For this purpose, design work has been performed for concept, sequence and typical simulation of BL replacement in the VV and rail deployment/storage of the RH equipment in the cask, including cask docking. In particular, the technical issues of the rail connection in the cask are (1) tight tolerance of a pin at a hinge, (2) limited space for the connection inside a cask and (3) tight positioning accuracy. This paper summarizes the idea to solve these issues and the results of the design work. The paper also introduces new cable handling equipment, rail support equipment and BL module transporter. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The whole ITER Remote Maintenance System (IRMS) is of unprecedented complexity and includes specifically developed technologies. Its procurement and start of operation will represent a major innovation to maintenance in hostile environments. Europe is a key contributor, with three remote handling (RH) systems, a.k.a. packages, plus a robotic inspection and metrology tool, currently under design. This paper gives an update on the status of design and procurement activities related to the IRMS. It will first introduce some key aspects of the reactor remote maintainability, and then give an overview of the present configuration of the global system. After this, the scope, status and challenges of the European (EU) packages will be illustrated in more detail, together with some key technological developments. Finally, the way all these efforts are coordinated will be presented together with the overall implementation scenario and milestones, and the way they fit with ITER construction and operation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",OVER,ITER,(general/none),2018,ITER; Remote handling; Remote maintenance,Maintainability; Materials handling; Remote control; Development activity; ITER; Nuclear fusion reactors; Remote handling; Remote maintainabilities; Remote maintenance; Remote maintenance system; Technological development; Nuclear reactors,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047067132

The ITER project position is that dose rates inside the cryostat be kept low enough to allow for human access shortly after shutdown for limited periods to provide rescue and/or maintenance activities. The methodology of estimation for dose rates after shutdown in such a complex geometry machine is discussed. The Monte Carlo method is preferable to conduct neutron transport calculations in the ITER geometry. The Conversion Factor method, which was used for dose rate estimation in the 1998 ITER shielding design, is described with an example of dose rate estimation around penetrations in the vacuum vessel. A Full Monte Carlo method is proposed showing the possibility of eliminating uncertainty accompanied with conversion factors from neutron flux or isotope production rate to dose rate after shutdown. © 2014 Atomic Energy Society of Japan.

Owing to the harsh environment, Remote Handling (RH) systems are used for inspection and maintenance of the tokamak in-vessel components. As the number of in-vessel components requiring RH maintenance is large, physical prototyping of all strategies becomes a major challenge. The operation of RH systems poses further challenge as all equipment have to be controlled remotely within very strict accuracy limits with minimum reliance on the available camera feedback. In both design and operation phases of RH equipment, application of Virtual Reality (VR) becomes imperative. The scope of this paper is to introduce some applications of VR in the design and operation cycle of RH, which are not available commercially. The paper discusses the requirement of VR as a tool for RH equipment design and operation. The details of a comprehensive VR facility that has been established to support the RH development for Indian tokamaks are also presented. Further, various cases studies are provided to highlight the utilization of this VR facility within phases of RH development and operation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,(none),IN-VESSEL,2017,Remote handling; Tokamak; Virtual reality,Equipment; Materials handling; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Virtual reality; Design and operations; Development and operations; Harsh environment; In-vessel components; Inspection and maintenance; Physical prototyping; Remote handling; Tokamak; Magnetoplasma,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016006805

The feasibility demonstration will be performed on the thermonuclear experimental Tokamak: Tore Supra, located in Cadarache facilities. The manipulator developed by the Interactive Robotics Unit of CEA-LIST will be used for close inspection intervention tasks in a Tokamak. The robot must meet severe specifications: small diameter, long reach with a 9.5 m cantilever length, high dexterity to move in a Torus shape environment and able to carry a 10kg payload on its end effector. As the robot must be introduced without breaking the machine conditioning, it has to cope with the vacuum and temperature constraints: Ultra High Vacuum (10-6 Pa) and 120°C in use, 200°C during baking phase. This long reach multi-link carrier has 10 DOF (9 rotary joints and 1 prismatic joint). It is composed of 5 modules and a precise guiding and pushing system (the deployer) for a total weight of about 300 kg. The gravity effect in the manipulator is largely compensated by a special mechanical structure (the parallelogram) that helps reducing the size of the actuators. The severe operating conditions impose a selection of several vacuum and temperature technologies that have been tested, qualified or optimized to cope with the requirements. In September 2007, the Remote Handling Equipment deployment under atmospheric conditions in a real Tokamak environment (Tore Supra) enabled to qualify the entire prototype. The scenario has to be rehearsed under vacuum and temperature to achieve the complete feasibility demonstration of a Tokamak close inspection by means of a robotic equipment under real operating conditions. The demonstration is an important step in the project but further developments are or could be necessary to cope with 100% of the requirements toward a reliable industrial prototype. In particular, due to its size and weight, this large robot manipulator holds lots of elastic and geometric deformations. Thus its accuracy is a challenge. A mechanical model could be developed to take into consideration the flexibilities of the structure and by means of calibration, the model parameters could be identified and then integrated in a real time controller. Further advanced developments on the on line monitoring system are also necessary for operator assistance and fault detection. ©2008 IEEE.",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2008,,Controllers; Demonstrations; Experimental reactors; Fault detection; Fusion reactors; Inspection; Intelligent robots; Manipulators; Materials handling; Remote control; Robot applications; Robotics; Sailing vessels; Vacuum; Atmospheric conditions; Cadarache; Further development; Geometric deformations; Gravity effects; Interactive robotics; ITER-relevant; Long reach; Mechanical model; Mechanical structures; Model parameters; Multi-link; On-line monitoring system; Operating condition; Prismatic joint; Real operating conditions; Real time controllers; Remote handling; Robot manipulator; Robotic equipments; Robotic systems; Rotary joint; Small-diameter; Tore Supra; Ultra high vacuum; End effectors,,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-69549092094

The reliability of the system can be improved by reviewing the failure events of the system caused by high radiation. A failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) identified failure modes and determined that lubricants, O-rings, and electric insulation cables were the dominant components affecting radiation hardness. Accordingly, we tried to optimize the lubricants and cables of the AC servo motors by using polyphenyl ether (PPE)-based grease and polyether ether ketone (PEEK), respectively. Materials containing radiation protective agents were also selected for the cable sheaths and O-rings to improve radiation hardness. Gamma ray irradiation tests were performed on these components and as a result, a radiation hardness of 8 MGy was achieved for the AC servo motors. On the other hand, to develop the radiation hardness and BRHS compatibility furthermore, the improvement of materials of cable and O ring were performed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2016,ITER blanket remote handling system; Radiation hardness; Remote maintenance,AC motors; Cables; Electric insulation; Ethers; Failure modes; Gamma rays; Hardness; Irradiation; Ketones; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Radiation; Radiation effects; Remote control; Servomotors; Failure mode and effects analysis; Gamma-ray irradiation tests; High radiation environment; Polyether ether ketones (PEEK); Protective agents; Radiation hardness; Remote handling system; Remote maintenance; O rings,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949659502

According to the ITER R&D program, a rail-mounted vehicle-type remote handling (RH) system has been developed, and its applicability to blanket maintenance has been demonstrated through fabrication and testing of prototypes. Based on this, a full-scale blanket RH test platform is being fabricated in order to demonstrate the remote replacement of a full-scale blanket module of about 4 tons dead weight. The test platform is basically composed of a vehicle manipulator operating on a toroidal rail, for handling a blanket module in a 180° in-vessel region, a receiver for transporting a module from the manipulator to a transfer cask for delivery to the hot cell, rail deployment and supports. These RH equipment/tools were due to be completed by the end of June 1997 and, thereafter, assembled into the blanket RH test platform. This paper describes the progress and outlines the main RH equipment/tools for the blanket RH test platform. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

A remote handling (RH) system, which uses the radiation-enhanced automation equipment and is controlled remotely by operators, is adopted. The engineering design of the CFETR RH system has been conducted in the past few years with a novel maintenance strategy of transferring the blanket and divertor components through the vertical upper port. A heavy-load robotic manipulator is illustrated, entering the CFETR vessel through an equatorial port to implement in-vessel maintenance tasks with exchangeable end-effectors and support blanket and divertor RH system. An integrated supervisory control system is being developed to provide a safe, reliable, and user-friendly control interface. Finally, despite all the progress that the CFETR RH team has made, it can be said that the CFETR RH system still faces challenges considering the hostile environment as well as the complex and heavy load maintenance process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",OVER,CFETR,IN-VESSEL,2022,Blanket; CFETR; Divertor; Manipulator; Remote handling,Maintenance; Manipulators; Materials handling; Nuclear reactors; Blanket; Chinese fusion engineering test reactor; Core components; Divertor; Extreme environment; Fusion Engineering; Heavy loads; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Vacuum vessel; Remote control,"University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province, (GXXT-2020-010); National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Program of China, (2017YFE0300503); National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Program of China",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124502029

The design of the following equipment has been adapted for the smaller machine with reduced access space for the RH equipment: the RH equipment used for the in-vessel RH operations to be deployed from the casks, the RH equipment that is used to remove the in-port assemblies (port plugs), as well as the remotely operated casks, which, with the use of double-door systems, can be attached to and removed from vacuum vessel ports. Defective components are loaded in transfer casks and moved by means of a remotely operated air floatation system attached underneath the cask, to the hot cell facility, where they dock against identical port interfaces and unload the component for remote refurbishment and/or waste storage. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The JET MkIIa divertor has been successfully removed and replaced with the MkII gas box divertor configuration using only remote handling methods inside the JET torus. This shutdown required the handling of over 450 components over a 15 week period operating 20 h per day and 6 days per week. The JET remote handling equipment functioned and performed almost flawlessly with only two significant faults. The total operational time lost due to equipment problems was less than 3 days. The operations proceeded safely and without significant problems. No time was lost due to either operator induced equipment problems or operational errors. A number of new tasks were successfully included in the operations at short notice. Some new tasks were identified immediately before the shutdown but with sufficient time available to test their feasibility using the mock-up facility. Others were only evident after the shutdown had started. The successful implementation of the shutdown and in particular of the unprepared tasks has been due to the high degree of adaptability provided by the JET man-in-the-loop remote handling approach.,EXP,JET,IN-VESSEL,1999,,Deuterium; Nuclear energy; Radioactivity; Reactor shutdowns; Remote control; Tritium; Divertor; Joint European torus; Remote handling operations; Tokamak devices,,Elsevier Sequoia SA,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033225212

This is a complex and time consuming remote handling operation and its duration directly affects the availability and therefore the commercial viability of the power plant. A tool is needed to allow the maintenance duration to be determined so that developments in component design can be assessed in terms of their effect on the maintenance duration. This allows the correct balance to be drawn between component cost and performance on the one hand and the remote handling cost and plant availability on the other. The work to develop this tool has begun with an estimate of the maintenance duration for a fusion power plant based on the EFDA DEMO WP12 pre-conceptual design studies [1]. The estimate can be readily adjusted for changes to the remote maintenance process resulting from design changes. The estimate uses data extrapolated from recorded times and operational experience from remote maintenance activities on the JET tokamak and other nuclear facilities. The Power Plant Conceptual Study from 2005 [2] proposes that commercial viability of a power plant would require an availability of 75% or above. Results from the maintenance estimate described in this paper suggest that this level of availability could be achieved for the planned maintenance using a highly developed and tested remote maintenance system, with a large element of parallel working and challenging but feasible operation times. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The topic is connected to licensing procedures for ITER: The need to assess risks related to the external transfer of beryllium and radioactive matter with tritium and activation products. Ten adhesive carbon pads were placed in different locations on the robotic arm operated in-vessel for 672 h. Also air samplers were used during the RH operation and smear tests of the RH boom were performed to quantify specific contamination levels by beryllium and tritium. Dust morphology was determined by microscopy techniques. The areal density of dust varies at different sticker position on the boom. On some parts (e.g. 'wrists' of the robot) the density of particles exceeds 1000 per mm2. Their morphology is very diverse but most collected objects originate from the construction material (aluminium) of the RH equipment itself. The accumulation of Be- A nd W-based particles is negligible. The study confirms earlier experimental evidence that Be-rich co-deposits (and also W coatings on CFC) adhere well to plasma-facing components and they are not easily mobilised. © Marek Rubel.,ASSESS,JET,REMOTE,2020,Beryllium; Dust; Jet-ITER like wall; Licensing; Remote handling,Adhesives; Beryllium; Cobalt deposits; Dust; Morphology; Risk assessment; Tritium; Activation products; Contamination levels; Density of particles; Experimental evidence; Licensing procedures; Microscopy technique; Plasma-facing components; Remote handling; Construction equipment,"H2020 Euratom, (633053); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2015–04844); Ministerstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego, MNiSW",Institute of Physics Publishing,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084681854

Due to the 9-m-long cantilever arm, the large flexibility of the EAMA robot introduces a problem in the accurate positioning. This article presents an autonomous robot control to cope with the robot positioning problem, which is a visual servo approach in context of tile grasping for the EAMA robot. In the experiments, the proposed method was implemented in a simulation environment to position and track a target graphite tile with the EAMA robot. As a result, the proposed visual control scheme can successfully drive the EAMA robot to approach and track the target tile until the robot reaches the desired position. Furthermore, the functionality of the simulation software presented in this paper is proved to be suitable for the development of the robotic and computer vision application. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The concept design on RH maintenance of CFETR has been done in the past year. It is known that, the RH maintenance is one of the most important parts for Tokamak reactor. The fusion power was designed as 50-200 MW and its duty cycle time (or burning time) was estimated as 30-50%. The center magnetic field strength on the TF magnet is 5.0 T, the maximum capacity of the volt seconds provided by center solenoid winding will be about 160 VS. The plasma current will be 10 MA and its major radius and minor radius is 5.7 m and 1.6 m respectively. All the components of CFETR which provide their basic functions must be maintained and inspected during the reactor lifetime. Thus, the remote handling (RH) maintenance system should be a key component, which must be detailedly designed during the concept design processing of CFETR, for the operation of reactor. The main design work for RH maintenance in this paper was carried out including the divertor RH system, the blanket RH system and the transfer cask system.

The European Domestic Agency (EU DA, i.e. Fusion for Energy, F4E) is providing important support to the ITER Organisation (IO) in specifying the functional requirements of the Remote Handling (RH) Procurement Packages (i.e. the subsystems allocated to EU DA belonging to the overall ITER Remote Maintenance Systems IRMS), and in performing design and R&D activities - with the support of national laboratories and industries - in order to define a sound concept for these packages. Furthermore, domestic industries are being involved in the subsequent detailed design, validation, manufacturing and installation activities, in order to actually fulfil our procurement-in-kind obligations. After an introduction to ITER Remote Maintenance, this paper will present status and next stages for the RH systems allocated to EU DA, and will also illustrate complementary aspects related to cross cutting technologies like radiation tolerant components and RH control systems. Finally, the way all these efforts are coordinated will be presented together with the overall implementation scenario and key milestones. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",OVER,ITER,(general/none),2014,F4E; IO; ITER; Maintenance; Remote handling,Design; Materials handling; Remote control; Supply chains; Cross-cutting technology; F4E; Installation activities; IO; ITER; Nuclear fusion reactors; Remote handling; Remote maintenance system; Maintenance,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905965341

Telemanipulated task execution is however characterised by long execution times compared to similar tasks performed hands-on. There is little quantitative research on task performance of telemanipulated maintenance available to give insight into most effective areas for improvement. In this paper a detailed analysis of real world remote maintenance at fusion plant JET is performed with the aim to: i) identify bottlenecks in task completion time and ii) quantify the room for potential improvement. Video recordings of the installation of 50 tiles executed by the three official master-slave operators were analysed. The task execution was characterised by a large variation in time performance, between but also within operators. Reduction of this variation could theoretically result in time reduction up to 41%. Recurring tasks like ‘rough/fine approach’ and ‘retreat’ covered more than 50% of the total task completion time and were identified as most promising for further improvement. The results will be the base for further research on operator assistance with augmented visual or haptic guidance. © 2017 EURATOM",ASSESS EXP,JET,IN-VESSEL,2018,Human factors; Remote maintenance; Task analysis; Task performance; Teleoperation,Air navigation; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Job analysis; Remote control; Haptic guidance; Human-in-the-loop; Quantitative research; Remote maintenance; Task analysis; Task completion time; Task executions; Task performance; Maintenance,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053); H2020 Euratom, EURATOM",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030632727

As preparation began for the JET EP2 (Enhanced Performance 2) shutdown it was recognised that the VR system being used was unable to cope with the increased functionality and the large number of 3D models needed to fully represent the JET in-vessel components and tooling planned for EP2. A bespoke VR software application was developed in collaboration with the OEM, which allowed enhancements to be made to the VR system to meet the requirements of JET remote handling in preparation for EP2. Performance improvements required to meet the challenges of EP2 could not be obtained from the development of the new VR software alone. New methodologies were also required to prepare source, CATIA models for use in the VR using a collection of 3D software packages. In collaboration with the JET drawing office, techniques were developed within CATIA using polygon reduction tools to reduce model size, while retaining surface detail at required user limits. This paper will discuss how these developments have played an essential part in facilitating EP2 remote handling task development and examine their impact during the EP2 shutdown. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This is fundamental to plan safe operation and maintenance of the European DEMO Fusion Power Plant. The study is focused on the estimation of activation responses to electronics and workers, in representative rooms of the DEMO building housing those pipes carrying activated water coming from the water cooled breeding blankets (WCLL BB). The prediction of some radiation-related quantities is needed in order to evaluate feasibility for functioning of rad-sensible components (e.g. electronic and electrical equipment) as well as for manual maintenance planning. The feasibility for placing rad-sensible equipment near the activated water pipes is determined by calculating the accumulated dose in silicon (due to both neutrons and photons), and neutron fluence rate. Besides, the viability for manual maintenance activities is evaluated by calculating residual dose rate for workers. These quantities are assessed in a representative room containing the pipes as well as in an adjacent room. In view of future developments on DEMO designs a parametric study has been performed and a compendium of different configurations is considered: several numbers of pipes, pipes dimensions and thickness of the wall separating both rooms are examined, as well as different delay times. Additionally, a study dedicated to the shielding improvement of both rooms is presented considering such parametric variations. © 2020",ASSESS,DEMO,(general/none),2020,Activated water; DEMO layout; Dose; Maintenance; Shielding,Breeding blankets; Conceptual design; Plant shutdowns; Reactor shielding; Shielding; Water pipelines; Activated water; DEMO layout; Dose; Electrical equipment; Maintenance planning; Neutron fluence rate; Parametric variation; Radiation environments; Maintenance,"Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053); Comunidad de Madrid, (S2013/MAE-2745); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación, MICINN, (ENE2013-43650-R)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078286298

Particularly, in the framework of the grant F4E-2008-GRT-09-PNS-TBM, CEA/IRFM has contributed to the test blanket module system (TBS) design and robot access feasibility study in the Port Cell. Simulations of the maintenance procedure were studied and fully integrated to the design process, enabling to provide space reservation for human and robotic access. For this mean, CEA/IRFM has used a CEA LIST Virtual Reality simulation software directly integrated to the Solidworks CAD software. The feasibility to connect/dis-connect the pipes in front of the Bioshield by a set of potential standard industrial arms was demonstrated. Aiming to give more realism to maintenance scenario and CAD models, CEA IRFM has decided to build a Virtual Reality platform in the institute, integrated to the design office.

Mineral insulated cables route the electrical and optical diagnostics sensor signals from the divertor area to the diagnostic hall. The diagnostic divertor cassettes are replaced during maintenance, which raises the requirement for a connector between divertor cassette and in-vessel wall. Since it needs to be handled remotely during the installation of the 16 diagnostic divertor cassettes, it is called Remote Handling Connector. Its operating space is limited and its environmental conditions are ultra-high vacuum, baking temperature 350 °C, irradiation and challenging electromagnetic forces. The preliminary design of the Remote Handling Connector is based on the conceptual design of Outboard and Inboard Configurations and is highly impacted by finding an appropriate balance between the external and internal space limitations and system requirements. The design of the system has been an iterative process including several conceptual and mechanical design phases, thermal, magnetic and structural load analysis, risk analysis, and remote handling assessment. Mock-ups were manufactured and tested at Divertor Test Platform 2 and Remote Handling Connector Platform at VTT Tampere Finland. The developed system was evaluated at a preliminary design review meeting organized at the end of 2019.

Changes to the launcher design associated with the accessibility, maintainability and manageability of replaceable components are presented. Captive bolts were placed along the flange of the Blanket Shielding Module (BSM). A hinge mechanism was integrated to simplify the (dis-)mounting of the BSM and a frame with incorporated cooling and actuation lines was suggested for simplified mounting and replacement of the steerable mirrors. Rotating the upper port plug upside-down improves maintenance access and component handling. Tools are proposed for manipulation of the port plug and its sub-components. The RH compatibility analysis can improve a design. Early consideration of RH requirements and implementation of necessary features is therefore vital. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The experimental device has been operating since 1983 and comprises a toroidal-shaped vacuum vessel in which high temperature plasma is created and controlled. Since the start of the project there has been a requirement to design and prepare a remote handling system that could be used to maintain and repair the torus during periods when radiation levels restricted personnel access. During late 1997 a series of experiments using deuterium and tritium fuel mixtures were performed which resulted in the torus becoming radioactive to a level which prohibited personnel access for around one year. Almost immediately after the experiments, a major modification to the JET torus was required using remote handling methods alone.

In the framework of the grant F4E-2009-GRT-026, CEA IRFM studied the maintenance in parallel with the design of the antenna provided by CCFE. The RVTL are 8 components of the ICRH antenna which form the interface between the matching system and the four port junction integrating the straps. A folded stub is attached to the principal line to ensure water cooling of the interspace. At the front and the rear of the RVTL are installed double RF windows that provide the first tritium barrier. In case of failure of the first window, all the RVTL have to be replaced. Due to the contamination and activation, the replacement must take place in the hot cell. The complete maintenance sequence is studied. It starts when the PP is in place in the Tokamak equatorial port, it continues with: the preparation in the port cell, transfer to the HC, cleaning, RVTL replacement, returns to the port cell. It finishes with reconnection to the port. The ITER requirements [1] and the hot cell constraints [2] are used to extract specifications for the RH tooling (for handling, cutting, welding, etc.). Each step is studied and suitable tools identified. For specific steps, mechanical concepts for dedicated tools are proposed. Furthermore, the critical steps identified are simulated to check the feasibility. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",STRAT,ITER,RF-HCD,2013,Hot cell; ICRH antenna; ITER; Maintenance feasibility; Remote handling; Virtual reality,Cells; Cytology; Maintenance; Materials handling; Remote control; Tools; Virtual reality; Dedicated tools; Hot Cell; ICRH antennas; ITER; Maintenance procedures; Matching system; Principal lines; Remote handling; Antennas,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884979639

In previous work it was shown that representative maintenance tasks could be performed significantly faster with direct visual feedback than with camera feedback. In post-test interviews, operators indicated that they regarded the lack of 3D perception as the primary factor hindering their performance. This paper discusses various techniques to improve depth perception in teleoperation, including stereo vision, head tracking, virtual camera views and depth gauges. The most promising techniques were tested. Performance metrics included time-to-complete, path analysis and operator work-load. In a first experiment, artificial depth gauges views were tested in a 1:1 scale hardware testbed with mechanical master-slave manipulators handled by experienced operators. Robust real-time image processing was achieved with marker-based objects. The simple depth gauge and graphical overlay did not significantly improve task performance. Operators commented on their view of the task being ""obstructed"" by the graphical overlay, and the depth gauge was judged not very informative. In a second experiment, real time tracking was combined with VR display including stereo and head tracking. While stereo was found to improve the task performance significantly over the 1 camera (mono) condition, head tracking unexpectedly did not. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2013,Depth perception; Experimental procedure; ITER; Maintenance; Remote handling; Task performance,Cameras; Depth perception; Experiments; Gages; Image processing; Maintenance; Materials handling; Regression analysis; Remote control; Stereo vision; Visual communication; Experimental procedure; ITER; Maintenance operations; Master-slave manipulator; Performance metrics; Real-time image processing; Remote handling; Task performance; Tokamak devices,"ITER-NL; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884976511

In this context, a logistical simulation tool has been developed to quantitatively evaluate and compare different reactor and maintenance concepts within the DEMO project. The overall goal is to support the decision-making process during both the design and operation phase of the fusion power plant. Increasing the quality and consistency of the input data is necessary to be able to derive credible information from the simulation results to support the design and decision-making process. Such computational models – especially within complex systems like fusion power plants – require validation in form of a connection to the real world. With ongoing project progress more and more credible data will be available that can be integrated in the tool to refine and validate the results. In the future the tool can be part of a digital twin where the real-world is linked to a virtual environment along the life-cycle of a fusion power plant. Coming from a pre-operational simulation tool, predicting the maintenance duration to support design decisions, the tool may support maintenance control in later operations phase, based on physical data in real time. It is discussed how the tool should be further developed as the DEMO project progresses and how it can be adapted to the requirements of the respective project phases. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,DEMO,(general/none),2021,Decision support; DEMO maintenance logistics modelling tool; Development cycle; Digital twin; Modularity; Simulation,Decision making; Fusion reactions; Life cycle; Maintenance; Virtual reality; Decision supports; Decision-making process; DEMO maintenance logistic modeling tool; Development cycle; Fusion power plant; Modularity; Operation phase; Project progress; Real-world; Simulation; Decision support systems,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053); H2020 Euratom",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102134217

Water hydraulics and servo valves are currently used in the task but concerns exist with robustness and availability of suitable components. An alternative option is to use digital technology where on/off valves and intelligent control is used to produce proportional output. So far, no proper high-pressure on/off valves existed in the market and therefore a new concept was developed and tested with promising results. A mock-up of the remote handling system was used as test bench. The system was simulated in order to dimension the valve system and to tune the valve controller. A complete valve package with 16 prototype on/off valves and a manifold was manufactured and long-term tests of 60 working days was conducted. A new level of performance was demonstrated throughout the tests as tracking accuracies were approximately ten times better than with servo valve. Although some design faults where detected and system had faulty components, tracking accuracy was very good.

Many RH operations involving RH equipment, such as robotic manipulator arms, require millimeter accuracy, but camera views are often occluded or of poor quality, and might be unavailable during sensitive steps that require accurate, close-up views. Moreover, the VR system may not reflect the current scene accurately, as physical conditions may have changed under the harsh environment. The purpose of this research was to prototype and evaluate a novel software system, called 3D Node, that locates and detects the position and orientation of a piece of RH equipment or reactor element with respect to a stereo camera pair. The detection information is utilized to adjust the motion trajectories of a robotic manipulator arm. The 3D Node features stereo-camera calibration, target depth mapping, target position and orientation detection, and online target tracking.

It is anticipated that all handling operations associated with used components will have to be carried out using remote handling techniques. During plasma operations the In-Vessel Components are exposed to high levels of neutron activation. This activation results in high radiation dose rates and decay heating. This presents a significant problem for Remote Handling Equipment (RHE) in the AMF. The high dose rates require the equipment to be sufficiently radiation tolerant to allow it to work reliably for long periods. The decay heating requires forced cooling of newly removed IVC's while they are in storage. The duration of the storage is dependent on the decay heating reducing to a level that has been nominally set at <50 °C without active cooling in room temperature air. This paper summarises the progress made in 2012 on the conceptual design of the AMF and its facilities. The layout and proposed function of the main areas will be described along with the principles applied. The design of the AMF has evolved from a simple representation of the required facilities in 2011 to a concept that can be developed to support maintenance of DEMO. © 2014 EURATOM/CCFE Fusion Association.",FAC,DEMO,(general/none),2014,Active Maintenance Facility; DEMO; Hot cell; Maintenance; Remote handling,Chemical activation; Conceptual design; Dosimetry; Indium compounds; Materials handling; Remote control; DEMO; Hot Cell; In-vessel components; Maintenance facility; Neutron activation; Radiation dose rate; Radiation tolerant; Remote handling; Maintenance,"EFDA; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1); Research Councils UK, RCUK, (EP/I501045)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905979727

A first approach for CPRHS path optimization was previously proposed using line guidance as the navigation methodology to be adopted. This approach might not lead to feasible paths in new situations not considered during the previous work, as rescue operations. This paper addresses this problem by presenting a complementary approach for path optimization inspired in rigid body dynamics that takes full advantage of the rhombic like kinematics of the CPRHS. It also presents a methodology that maximizes the common parts of different trajectories in the same level of ITER buildings. The results gathered from 500 optimized trajectories are summarized.

In order to meet this requirement, it is essential to suppress the dynamic deflection and vibration of the remote handling equipment due to sudden transfer of the module weight from/to the back-plate supports to/from the equipment itself during installation and removal. A new control scheme was proposed and tested so as to suppress the dynamic behaviors. As a result, the dynamic deflection of the rail and the acceleration of the manipulator were successfully decreased to nearly zero. Based on the test results, the proposed control scheme was concluded to be effective so as to suppress this kind of dynamic effect during heavy component handling.",HARD,ITER,BLANKET,2000,,Acceleration control; Experimental reactors; Machine vibrations; Maintenance; Manipulators; Blanket remote maintenance; International thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER); Fusion reactors,,Elsevier Sequoia SA,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17144450661

Following ITER, the aim of DEMO is to demonstrate the capability of generating several hundreds of MW of net electricity by 2050. The main objective of this paper was the study of the most efficient design of the maintenance port for replacing the divertor cassettes in a Remote Handling (RH) point of view. In DEMO overall design, one important consideration is the availability and short down time operations. The inclination of the divertor port has a very important impact on all the RH tasks such as the design of the divertor mover, the divertor locking systems and the end effectors. The current reference scenario of the EU DEMO foresees a 45° inclined port for the remote maintenance (RM) of the divertor in the lower part of the reactor. Nevertheless, in the optic of the systems engineering (SE) approach, in early concept design phase, all possible configurations shall be taken into account. Even the solutions which seem not feasible at all need to be investigated, because they could lead to new and innovative engineering proposals. The different solutions were compared using an approach based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The technique is a multi-criteria decision making approach in which the factors that are important in making a decision are arranged in a hierarchic structure. The results of these studies show how the application of the AHP improved and focused the selection on the concept which is closer to the requirements arose from technical meetings with the experts of the RH field. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",ASSESS,DEMO,DIVERTOR,2016,AHP; Concept design; DEMO; Remote handling; Systems engineering,Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Fusion reactor divertors; Hierarchical systems; Locks (fasteners); Maintenance; Materials handling; Remote control; Systems engineering; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Concept designs; DEMO; Hierarchic structures; Innovative engineering; Multi criteria decision making; Remote handling; Remote maintenance system; Availability,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053); H2020 Euratom, EURATOM",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994060921

Because no human intervention can be envisaged, the remote systems will have to prove high reliability and rescue capabilities. The availability of the fusion facility will have to be maximized, as a consequence, the efficiency of the maintenance equipment will become a key factor. To fulfill these constraints, the remote maintenance principles will need to be simplified as much as possible and be taken into account at the early stages of the tokamak design. This is an iterative process between Tokamak and Maintenance designs in order to reach the best possible tradeoff. Such an exercise of this iterative work was done on the China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) preliminary design. Main targets were established in the view of optimization of the remote maintenance, then an assessment of the first maintenance scenario, envisaged for the in-vessel components, was done and alternative solutions were proposed. This process was repeated during meetings with the tokamak subsystem owners. This paper will present the results of a first phase of optimization that can represent the current state of the remote maintenance design for CFETR. The work has provided guidelines for main tokamak subsystems such as the magnet configuration, the blanket and divertor modularity, the neutron shielding and cryostat arrangement, and the transfer and hot cell configuration. It also produced some innovative solutions for the overall maintenance scheme like the implementation of a hot cell at the top of the tokamak hall avoiding cask transfers. On this basis a CFETR maintenance scenario is proposed. © 1973-2012 IEEE.",ASSESS,CFETR,(general/none),2018,Fusion reactor design; maintenance; remote handling; tokamak,Availability; Electric inductors; Magnetic fields; Magnetic shielding; Magnetism; Maintainability; Nuclear reactors; Optimization; Reactor shielding; Shielding; Tokamak devices; Fusion reactor designs; Magnetic noise; Remote handling; tokamak; Toroidal magnetic fields; Maintenance,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041186716

Autonomous air cushion transporter, pallet, sealed casks and tractor movers needed for port plug mounting/dismantling operation were analysed. For each sub-system, the breakdown of significant components was outlined and, for each component, possible failure modes have been investigated pointing out possible causes, possible actions to prevent the causes, consequences and actions to prevent or mitigate consequences. Off-normal events which may result in hazardous consequences to the public and the environment have been defined as Postulated Initiating Events (PIEs). Two safety-relevant PIEs have been defined by assessing elementary failures related to the analysed system. Each PIE has been discussed in order to qualitatively identify accident sequences arising from each of them. As an output of this FMEA study, possible incidental scenarios, where the intervention of rescue RH equipments is required to overcome critical situations determined by fault of RH components, were defined as well. Being rescue scenarios of main concern for ITER remote handling activities, such families could be helpful in defining the design requirements of port handling systems in general and on RH transfer system in particular. Furthermore, they could be useful in defining casks and vehicles to be used for rescue activities. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The identification of impending mechanical failures of the RMS equipment during active maintenance operations is crucial if unscheduled and or unplanned recovery and rescue operations are to be avoided. The purpose of this research is to provide cost-benefit analysis and assessment of the effectiveness of the condition monitoring system (CMS) at reducing costs as well as improving the reliability of DEMO RMS. The research is also steering the CMS design requirements from a performance perspective. It is focused on the blanket transporter (BT), which is a critical component for conducting maintenance operations on DEMO. The results show that the CMS repayment could happen after 1 maintenance mission period and describe the other major benefits that are not easily quantifiable into common metric. The main assumption for this research is that by increasing the detection of a failure mode, the likelihood of the failure mode happening will decrease, and hence it will result in savings in availability and downtime. © 2020 The Authors",ASSESS,DEMO,(general/none),2020,Condition monitoring; Cost-benefit; DEMO RMS; Fusion,Condition monitoring; Costs; Failure (mechanical); Maintenance; Outages; Reliability analysis; Condition monitoring systems; Critical component; Economic feasibilities; Maintenance operations; Mechanical failures; Reducing costs; Remote maintenance system; Rescue operations; Cost benefit analysis,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; H2020 Euratom, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092619344

An easy maintenance scheme is indispensable for high availability operation. For the easy maintenance scheme, a plasma configuration with high aspect ratio (with slender doughnut shape) of about 6 and a small number of 12 torus sectors is introduced. The adjacent torus sectors are jointed mechanically by a bolt-flange structure. The plasma vacuum region comprises a cryostat system and 12 horizontal access doors. A whole section of each torus sector is pulled out horizontally in a single radial straight motion between the adjacent toroidal field (TF) coils. The TF coil system is imbedded in the reactor building and can be repaired independent of the torus structure. The torus structure consists of a shield integrated vacuum vessel, a divertor structure and a tritium fuel breeding blanket structure. The divertor or blanket system is replaced from the transverse (toroidal) direction after the torus structure is pulled out. Even in the torus inboard region, there is a gap of 1 m between adjacent TF coils because of the high aspect ratio reactor configuration. Therefore, all the piping and feeder systems are gathered at the torus inboard region. The overall machine size is determined by a fusion power of 3 GW and almost 100% bootstrap current with a moderate Troyon coefficient of 3.5, magnetohydrodynamic safety factor of 5 and plasma elongation of 1.6. © 1994.",SYS,DREAM,(general/none),1994,,Breeding blankets; Experimental reactors; Fusion reactions; Magnetic circuits; Magnetohydrodynamics; Maintenance; Nuclear power plants; Plasmas; Tritium; Bolt flange structure; Divertor structure; Integrated vacuum vessel; Plasma vacuum; Steady state tokamak reactor; Toroidal field coil; Tokamak devices,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028483480

Due to the redundancy and total length (8.7395 m) of manipulator and the narrow space in the CASK and the curved vacuum vessel(VV), it is difficult to perform online collision-free end effector trajectory tracking on EAMA. Current solution is to record a feasible trajectory offline by the operator after thousands of trials and errors as the reference for EAMA to track, which is time-consuming, inefficient, not friendly to operators, absence of resistance to external disturbances and difficult to be combined with other maintenance tasks like visual servoing. This paper proposes a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) based online trajectory tracking method, which is easy to use and flexible. The trajectory tracking problem is elegantly formulated as an optimization problem to minimize the end effector's tracking error while satisfying nonlinear constraints consisting of boundaries of state, output and control input, kinematic model of EAMA and collision avoidance constraints. Besides, a two-step recursive solver is developed to speed up the solving of NMPC problem to guarantee real-time control. The effectiveness and good performance of this method are demonstrated by an inspection simulation where the end effector tracks a semicircular trajectory. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,EAST,IN-VESSEL,2021,Collision avoidance; Nonlinear model predictive control; Redundant robot motion control; Remote handling; Trajectory tracking,Constraint satisfaction problems; End effectors; Kinematics; Maintenance; Manipulators; Nonlinear systems; Predictive control systems; Real time control; Tokamak devices; Trajectories; Visual servoing; Experimental advanced superconducting tokamaks; External disturbances; Inspection simulation; Non-linear constraints; Nonlinear model predictive control; Optimization problems; Trajectory tracking method; Trajectory tracking problems; Model predictive control,"China National Special Project for Magnetic Confinement Fusion Science Program, (2017YFE0300503); Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, CASHIPS, (YZJJ2020QN12)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097789981

ITER is such an example where a dexterous teleoperation system is required for remote handling tasks in a nuclear environment. The compactness of space, high load capacity and reliability makes hydraulic manipulator an obvious choice. However, possible oil leakage from traditional hydraulic systems and the characteristics of water (fire and environmentally safe, chemically neutral, not activated, not affected by radiation) makes the use of water hydraulics the only choice.

The CFETR divertor is a key in-vessel plasma-facing component, which will suffer from sputtering erosion and exfoliation caused by intense plasma bombardment, severe heat fluxes, and neutron irradiation. Due to neutron activation of in-vessel components, remote handling (RH) technology has been considered as one of the essential issues of the CFETR divertor. In this article, a new concept of an integral hybrid divertor blanket for the CFETR is proposed, which is feasible for installation and disassembly in CFETR vacuum vessel by RH. Dome is an important part of the CFETR divertor, which comprises 80 modules, and each module is composed of flat-type plasma-facing units (PFUs), steel supports (SSs), and RH compatible structures. Every Dome module is connected to the CFETR blanket by RH compatible structures.

Analysis on the plasma vertical stability indicates that the BSAV scheme with double-loop shell is the most effective on plasma vertical stability. Design and preliminary assessment of in-vessel transferring mechanism and pipe connection were investigated.

When the ITER has stopped plasma operations for maintenance, the BRHS will be installed in the vacuum vessel, whose components are radioactive, to remove and install the FWs and SBs. Therefore, the BRHS will be operated in a high radiation environment (up to 250 Gy/h) having an estimated total dose of 5 MGy during maintenance (maximum of two years). The radiation hardness requirement for ITER BRHS components is 1 MGy total dose. As components may degrade by gamma irradiation, some equipment is expected to malfunction which causes delays in the in-vessel maintenance schedule. Therefore, failure mode and effects analyses (FMEA) were performed on the BRHS components and FMEA results suggest trouble with the power supply and signals due to degradation of the insulation of electrical components, and malfunctioning motors due to degradation of the lubricants of mechanical components.

As the FE analysis of the BRHS predicted a vertical mode ∼8 Hz, which coincides with a major natural frequency of the vacuum vessel of ITER, evaluating the dynamic response of the BRHS experimentally and measuring the system's damping is indispensable in verifying the structural design of the system. Recent preliminary impact testing on the full-scale mock-up of the BRHS showed that the mock-up has a vertical major natural mode having a natural frequency of ∼7.5 Hz and a damping ratio of 0.5%.

It was confirmed that the natural major frequencies obtained in the experiments are in agreement with the major frequencies obtained via analysis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,BLANKET,2016,Impact hammer test; ITER; Modal analysis; Remote maintenance,Damping; Hammers; Impact testing; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Mockups; Modal analysis; Natural frequencies; Remote control; Structural design; Damping ratio; Impact hammer tests; ITER; Remote handling system; Remote maintenance; Seismic analysis; Vacuum vessel; Vertical modes; Finite element method,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960877747

DEMO will take fusion from experimental research into showing the potential for commercial power generation. During the fusion reaction, components in the tokamak become highly activated. The estimated dose rate levels after shutdown (zero decay time) due to 60 dpa accumulation in steel (blanket) and 30 dpa (divertor) are 13.1-17.4 kGy/h (blanket); 8.8-11.6 kGy/h (divertor) [1], much higher than those to be encountered at ITER. Upon removal from the tokamak, components would be transported to the hot cell facility with attention to minimizing the spread of activated dust and tritium contamination. It is proposed to use a sealed cask of ∼20 tonnes, running on air castors with 50% lifting capability redundancy. Due to the number and complexity of the routes taken by this transporter it would have to be an un-tethered semi-autonomous system. This poses some technical challenges, including providing sufficient battery capacity, reliable guidance and a fail safe un-tethered control system. The mass of the components being moved is assumed here to range from a few tonnes to in excess of one hundred tonnes. Before the removed in-vessel components can be processed in the hot cell, they would require a period of cooling, approximately 2.5 years, to allow dose rate and decay heating to reduce. This reduces the decay heating level to ∼1-1.5 kW/m3 and a contact dose rate to ∼250 Sv/h, which is more suited to dexterous man-in-the-loop remote handling (RH). During maintenance, many components would require replacement or refurbishment. The hot cell facility would have to provide all the associated RH functions and operate fully remotely. With no human intervention, an accordingly robust RH recovery system would be required. This paper describes the first steps being taken towards the design of the DEMO hot cell. It will show a comparison of the current DEMO in-vessel maintenance concepts from a hot cell perspective, describe a proposed ex-vessel transport system, and summarize the facilities that have been identified as required within the hot cell, examine current RH technology and discuss the identified critical development issues. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",OVER,DEMO,(general/none) TRANSPORT,2013,DEMO; Hot cell; Manipulator; Remote handling,Maintenance; Manipulators; Plant shutdowns; Power plants; Remote control; DEMO; Experimental research; Hot Cell; Remote handling; Semi-autonomous systems; Specification and designs; Technical challenges; Tritium contamination; Materials handling,"H2020 Euratom; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1); Research Councils UK, RCUK",,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884986771

This set-up allows for maintenance of diagnostics, heating systems and first wall elements. The maintenance can be done in situ, or in the Hot Cell. Safe and effective remote handling (RH) will be ensured by the RH requirements and standards. Compliance is verified through remote handling compatibility assessments at the ITER Design Review milestones. The Remote Handling Study Centre at FOM Institute DIFFER is created to study ITER RH maintenance processes at different levels of complexity, from relatively simple situational awareness checks using snap-shots in the CAD system, time studies using virtual reality (VR) animations, to extensive operational sequence validation with multiple operators in real-time. The multi-operator facility mimics an RH work-cell as presently foreseen in the ITER RH control room. Novel VR technology is used to create a realistic setting in which a team of RH operators can interact with virtual ITER environments. A physics engine is used to emulate real-time contact interaction as to provide realistic haptic feed-back. Complex interactions between the RH operators and the control room system software are tested. RH task performance is quantified and operational resource usage estimated.

A roughing filter and an upper port plug are located inside each upper port. Vacuum Vessel (VV) in-service inspection and neutron flux monitor ports are located on the balcony area near the third Heating Neutral Beam (HNB). This paper describes the concept design of the Upper Port Remote Handling Equipment (UPRHE) that provides means to maintain the components at the upper ports and the balcony area within the NB cell. The UPRHE can move along the toroidal direction to access the upper ports and can deploy various remote handling (RH) tools into the upper ports to access the components that require maintenance. The UPRHE consists of permanent installations in the NB cell and removable equipment that is transferred from the Hot Cell Facility to the NB cell only when carrying out the maintenance activities. The permanent equipment is the cabling device mounted on wall. The removable equipments are the upper port trolley, manipulator transporter, end-effectors, manipulators, and other RH tools. The concept design and the RH compatibility assessment demonstrate that the proposed UPRHE can perform the identified tasks and is ready to move on to the next design phase. © 2021",HARD,ITER,NBI,2021,ITER; Neutral beam cell; Remote handling; Upper port,Cells; Cytology; Maintenance; Manipulators; Materials handling; Remote control; Concept designs; Handling equipments; Handling tools; ITER; ITER tokamak; Neutral beam cell; Neutral beams; Remote handling; Upper port; Upper port plug; Particle beams,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107732357

Experience at predecessor JET showed that a human-in-the-loop tele-operated approach is crucial, although this approach entails drawbacks such as the unavoidable extensive operator training and relatively long execution times. These drawbacks are common knowledge, but little quantitative research is available to guide improvements (such as improved training methods, or active operator support systems). The aim of this paper is to identify the key areas for further improvement of tele-operated maintenance. This is achieved by a detailed task analysis based on recent maintenance at JET, using task logbooks and video data as well as interviews with experienced master-slave operators. The resulting task analysis shows the (sub)tasks that were most time-consuming and shows a large variance in time performance within operators, but also substantial differences between qualified operators with different levels of experience. The operator interviews indicate that intuitive (virtual) visual feedback and artificial (guiding) forces are promising directions for improvement. The results found in this study will be used for future research and development activities focusing on haptic guiding strategies, with the aim to further design and optimize RH maintenance systems for ITER and beyond. © 2014 EURATOM.",EXP,JET,(general/none),2014,ITER; JET experience; Remote maintenance; Task performance analysis; Tele-manipulation,Job analysis; Maintenance; Visual communication; ITER; Maintenance systems; Operator support system; Quantitative research; Remote maintenance; Research and development; Task performance; Telemanipulation; Personnel training,"FOM Institute; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905976675

The Tokamak infrastructure will become radioactive as the machine operates, which is an aspect that needs to be considered in the design of the planed in-situ maintenance activities. The occupational radiation exposure (ORE) must be accounted for, and an ALARA program must be implemented to minimize it. It requires the determination and analysis of shutdown dose rates fields, the purpose of D1SUNED tool. Common to all Direct one-step-based approaches, this tool needs to be fed with a nuclear data set tailored for each problem and produced ex professo. In this paper, we characterize the radioactive inventory relevant for the ORE of ITER maintenance activities using ACAB activation code. The ITER reference irradiation scenario SA-2 and the cooling times of interest 105 s and 106 s are considered. A comprehensive list of typical materials has been studied with detailed impurities content. The nuclear data set covers 99% of the radioactive inventory of concern, and all the pathways responsible for 99% of its production. It has been prepared following the ITER recommendations of cross-sections libraries and it has been verified against Rigorous-two steps calculations. This batch of nuclear data complements D1SUNED for shutdown dose rate exhaustive analysis for ITER with the perspective of maintenance according to the latest ITER nuclear data standards. © 2021",SOFT,ITER,(general/none),2021,ALARA; Direct one-step method; ITER; Nuclear data; Operational Radiation Exposure; Shutdown dose rate,Radioactivity; Tokamak devices; ALARA; Data set; Direct one-step method; Dose rate; ITER; Maintenance activity; Nuclear data; Operational radiation exposure; Radiation Exposure; Shutdown dose rate; Maintenance,"I+D en Tecnologías, (S2018/EMT-4437); Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020; Comunidad de Madrid; Euratom Research and Training Programme, (633053); Euratom Research and Training Programme; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (BES-2016-078586, ENE2015-70733R); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO; Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, UNED",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107646484

Considering the working environment for the divertor in Tokamak, the process for replacing is conducted by remote handling (RH) ways. In this paper, the work mainly focuses on the development of a new approach to the conceptual design of CFETR Divertor RH compatible structures. The approach is based on two theories: degree of freedom (DOF) and the stability.DOF theory requires the divertor should be constraint completely, and then its DOF is equal to zero. Besides that, the stability theory requires the divertor cannot be shaken due to the projection of the centre of mass and cannot be rotated due to the larger tilting moment. Then a new design scheme for the compatible structures is put forward based on theories to fulfill the working requirements. Finally, the simulation process in Delmia is carried on in order to validate the RH feasibility. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",SYS,CFETR,DIVERTOR,2020,CFETR; Divertor; DOF; Remote handling; Simuation process; Stability,Conceptual design; Convergence of numerical methods; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Materials handling; Remote control; CFETR; Degree of freedom (dof); Divertor; Fusion Engineering; Remote handling; Simulation process; Supporting structure; Working environment; Fusion reactor divertors,"Hefei University Foundation, (18-19RC53); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province, (GXXT-2019-048)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078702745

The large BB segments can therefore be removed through the upper ports of the vacuum vessel by a remotely operated transporter. The size of these ports is however restricted by the magnetic coils causing some of the BB segments to be accessible only on their extremities. The lifting point of these BB segments therefore is away from their centers of gravity also requiring the transfer of bending moments. A concept of the BB transporter was developed recently [1]. It has the required payload capacity and is capable of carrying out also the tilting maneuvers required to extract the BB segments from the VV. The gripper interlock is the interface to the BB segments and is described in this article including the function of its locking mechanism. It has the tightest space constraints of all BB transporter components, and its design is particularly challenging given the large loads to be transferred. The basic concept of the gripper interlock resembles a massive pin with a diameter of approximately 500 mm that is inserted into a countersunk hole in the backside of the BB segment and then locked by an actuated mechanism. The concept allows on the one hand the transfer of large bending moments. The engagement is on the other hand more challenging as compared to the hook of a conventional crane that is required to transfer vertical loads only. In addition the gripper interlock must be designed according to the rules defined for lifting equipment in nuclear power plants and considering increased requirements regarding qualification and in-service inspection since its failure can cause a load drop with the potential to damage the primary confinement. © 2023",HARD,DEMO,BLANKET,2023,DEMO; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Tokamak,Grippers; Nuclear fuels; Remote control; Center of gravity; DEMO; Locking mechanism; Magnetic coil; Materials degradation; Pay load capacity; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Tokamak; Vacuum vessel; Nuclear power plants,"European Commission, EC, (101052200 — EUROfusion)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151286505

There are two options for divertor, helium-cooled and water-cooled, the water-cooled one was focused in this paper. The upgraded divertor geometry has larger parameters in several directions, which was proposed from the beginning of 2020. Especially, the outer leg (the distance from X-point to the outer strike point) reaches 2.4 m, which is much longer than previous version. Basing on the overall layout of vacuum vessel, the divertor module could not be replaced through the lower ports. The first wall was separated from cassette and removed through upper port, and the cassette was replaced through upper port. The CFETR long leg RH compatibility divertor structure will be designed in detail. The remote handling of assembly and maintenance procedures were also designed, including the first wall separated from cassette and removed through upper port. The first wall was installed, welded and tested, and the cassette was RH assembled and maintained through upper port. Design results showed that the upgraded divertor has good compatibility with remote handling assembly and maintenance requirement. At last, the preliminary pressure drop analysis, thermal-mechanical analysis, electromagnetic force analysis and seismic analysis of the divertor system were done. The analysis results showed that the structure design could meet the operation requirements of CFETR. Maybe there are many design and analysis options for the remote handling compatibility of CFETR long leg divertor, this paper summarized one of the latest achievements in design and analysis.

The requirement for welding of the highest quality in a radioactive, magnetic and high temperature environment, places significant technical risks on the technologies selected for use. This paper reports the R&D activities undertaken to mitigate these risks and concludes with the key findings and recommendations for the ongoing design. Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW) trials demonstrated that a code compliant, autogenous butt weld of 3 mm wall thickness is possible, but requires precise process control, novel techniques, and tight tolerances on material composition. The most significant findings were that vertically-offset filler-rings could be employed to positive effect, and a controlled Sulphur content of 100–150 ppm for the stainless-steel pipework was found to be necessary. The galvanic cell technology selected for the welding back-purge oxygen sensor was tested and verified for use in operating environments of 300 Gy/h gamma dose rate, 3mT magnetic field, and 60 °C ambient temperature. Cutting trials developed optimum parameters for lathe-based orbital cutting with regards to the required tool longevity, the vacuum-clean environment and the need to re-weld the joint. Finally, Volumetric Inspection trials investigated the effectiveness of Electro Magnetic Transducer (EMAT) and Phased Array Ultrasonic Testing (PAUT) methods at detecting a range of manufactured surface and volumetric defects in the weld. EMAT was found better suited to the application, but the work highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of the detection needs and their relationship to potential failure modes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,DIVERTOR,2018,Cutting; Divertor; ITER; Pipe Maintenance; Remote Handling; Volumetric Inspection; Welding,Cooling water; Cutting; Cutting tools; Fusion reactor divertors; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Inspection; Magnetism; Materials handling equipment; Remote control; Ultrasonic testing; Water pipelines; Welding; Welds; Divertor; Gas tungsten arc welding; High-temperature environment; ITER; Potential failure modes; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Stainless steel pipework; Materials handling,"Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, CCFE, (F4E-OMF-340-1-01-03); Fusion for Energy, F4E",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048429777

Following ITER, DEMO aims to confirm the capability of generating several hundred of MW of net electricity by 2050. The main objective of these activities is to develop an efficient and reliable remote handling (RH) system for replacing the divertor cassettes. This paper presents the preliminary results of the concept design of the divertor RH system. The proposed divertor mover is a hydraulic telescopic boom driven from the transportation cask through the maintenance tunnel of the reactor. The boom is divided in three sections of 4 m each, and it is driving an end-effector in order to perform the scheduled operations of maintenance inside the vacuum vessel. Two alternative design of the end effector to grip and manipulate the divertor cassette are also presented in this work. Both the concepts are hydraulically actuated, basing on the ITER previous studies. The divertor cassette end-effector consists of a lifting arm linked to the divertor mover, a tilting plate, a cantilever arm and a hook-plate. The main objective of this paper is to illustrate the feasibility of DEMO divertor remote maintenance operations. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a SE approach, all the stakeholders’ needs can be considered, encompassing requirements coming from all the different fields connected to design. Adopting SE, the ranking of the proposed design alternatives can be carried out using Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methods, which foresee the involvement in the decision-making process of a team of experts. Among MCDM methods, fuzzy-based ones could be advantageous whenever the decision-making process is mainly based on experts’ sensibility, because there is a lack of reliable quantitative information and/or the project is in the very early stage. This is the typical case of R&D activities on nuclear fusion, where big projects (ITER, DEMO) must contend with significant uncertainties. Therefore, a MCDM-based SE approach could help to improve the progress of these projects. Several applications are recalled in this paper and a further case study, regarding the Automated Inspection and Maintenance Test Unit (AIM-TU) concept design, is presented. In the framework of EU DEMO project, the AIM-TU has been proposed to provide to the international community a facility able to perform, with high reliability, robotic maintenance and inspection procedures in DEMO-oriented environments. In this paper the SE approach has been applied to the AIM-TU concept selection, adopting the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process MCDM method for the best option selection.

Complutense 40, Madrid, Spain","The EU-DEMO (referred to as DEMO) tokamak complex currently consists of three buildings, like in ITER: the tokamak building, the tritium building and the diagnostics building. The tokamak building houses the tokamak itself and the numerous plant systems that interface with the necessary systems to produce and control the plasma. It is designed to permit assembly, operation and maintenance of the DEMO tokamak. The vacuum vessel is organized in 8 sectors, with radial ports at the lower and equatorial levels and one vertical upper port. The general architectural structure is arranged around the tokamak with a cylindrical bioshield of 2m thickness around the cryostat and floor levels corresponding to the cryostat penetrations. Additional levels are used for the integration of auxiliary equipment for the various plant systems and for accident mitigation systems. Currently, the tokamak building also represents the final nuclear confinement barrier for the radioactive material towards the environment and the public. This safety function requires the plant and safety systems to limit the release of radioactive substances during normal operation and in accidental conditions well below the safety limits. The complexity of a fusion power plant, like DEMO, with regards to integration of plant systems is much higher than that in a fission power plant due to the larger number of plant systems. Three main criteria drive the integration work of the plant systems inside the tokamak building: (i) safety requirements, (ii) functional requirements of the plant systems themselves and (iii) the maintenance approach. Cost considerations are also taken into account together with the normal and accidental environmental conditions in the various areas of the tokamak building that might challenge the qualifications of structures, systems and components (SSC). The layout of the tokamak building has to be further developed in the Concept Design Phase to follow the plant design evolution providing feedback to the various designers in order to assure that DEMO meets the cited design criteria with an optimized and licensable layout of the most complex nuclear building. © 2022",SYS,DEMO,(general/none),2022,DEMO; Layout; Maintenance criteria; Safety criteria; Tokamak building,Architectural design; Auxiliary equipment; Magnetoplasma; Maintenance; Materials handling; Radioactive materials; Assembly operations; DEMO; Integrated designs; Layout; Maintenance criteria; Operations and maintenance; Plant systems; Safety criterion; Tokamak building; Tokamak complex; Tokamak devices,"Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124430330

Prototyping work has been carried out for the development of individual sub-systems including RH equipment controller, viewing system, virtual reality monitoring system and RH plant controller built on the RH core system using the standard network communication protocols of ITER. All the individual sub-systems have been integrated into a prototype work cell and successfully tested on a COTS robot manipulator. This paper presents the design & implementation of the prototype work-cell and concludes by suggesting recommendations for the next version of the ITER RH core system. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",FAC,ITER,(general/none),2017,ITER; OROCOS; Remote handling; RH core system; Robotics; Virtual reality,Application programs; Control systems; Equipment; Manipulators; Materials handling; Monitoring; Open source software; Open systems; Remote control; Robot applications; Robotics; Standardization; Virtual reality; Controller interfaces; Core systems; Embedded control applications; Individual control; ITER; Open source tools; OROCOS; Remote handling; Controllers,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009192443

To accomplish this great mission, the big modular blanket option has been adopted to achieve the high efficiency of the blanket maintenance. Considering this mission and the large and heavy blanket module, a novel conceptual blanket maintenance system for CFETR has been carried out by us over the past year. This paper presents the conceptual design of the Blanket Remote Handling System (BRHS), which mainly comprises the In-Vessel-Maintenance-System (IVMS), Lifting System and Blanket-Tool-Manipulator System (BTMS). The BRHS implements the extraction and replacement between in-vessel (the blanket module operation configuration location) and ex-vessel (inside of the vertical maintenance cask) by the collaboration of these three sub systems. What is more, this paper represents the blanket maintenance procedure between the docking station (between hot cell building and tokamak building) and inside the vacuum vessel, in tokamak building. Virtual reality technology is also used to verify and optimize our concept design. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, laser ablation cutting, which vaporizes a small amount of solid material directly into gas by focusing a laser beam of high-density energy, is adopted in order to overcome the limitation of the normal laser cutting technology that the head should be placed as close to the work piece as possible to blow out melt metal at a distance. Complete cutting of a work piece is obtained by repetitive multi-passes of the laser beam. The welding and cutting process were tested on the sample work pieces and finally on a prototype of a hydraulic connection module for remote handling. The results showed that this process can be a promising candidate for hydraulic connections by remote handling. Furthermore the design of the hydraulic connection module has been updated to resolve some technical difficulties that were found during the test. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The main features of this scenario are: two upper, vertically arranged maintenance ports have to be opened for blanket maintenance on opposite sides of the tokamak. The MMSs are removed and inserted through both ports which are handled in parallel and independently. Inside the vessel maximum four in-vessel machines are operating to transport the elements in toroidal direction and also to insert and attach the MMS to the shield. Outside the vessel the elements have to be transported between the tokamak and the hot cell (also with two ports) either in casks or through a corridor. For this scenario corresponding maintenance times were calculated utilizing the industrial experience of Areva NP. The paper presents preliminary time estimates for the cask scenario as well as the corridor concept, and the obtained results show good potential for a high availability reactor. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is difficult to realize remote control due to its redundancy, coupling structure and the complex operational environment. The IK research of the robot played a vital role to the manipulator's motion control algorithm of remote handling (RH) technology. An Obstacle Topology Partition Projection (OTPP) approach integrated with Modified Inverse Depth First Search (MIDFS) method was presented. This is a kind of new geometric algorithm in order to solve the problem of IK for a high-redundancy manipulator.

The key purpose is to progressively increase the performance of the first ITER injector and to demonstrate its reliability at the maximum operation parameters: power delivered to the plasma 16.5 MW, beam energy 1 MeV, accelerated D - ion current 40 A, pulse length 3600 s. Several interventions for possible modifications and for maintenance are expected during the early operation of the ITER injector in order to optimise the beam generation, aiming and steering. The maintenance scheme and the related design solutions are therefore a very important aspect to be considered for the NBTF design.

Since the concept design of the MCS, the design is elaborated further detail considering new maintenance requirements, updated interfaces with the components to be maintained, and the latest configurations in the NB cell. The main design updates are described as follows. First, the railway is changed from the one monorail with two side reaction rails to a dual rail system, which has better load distribution within the crane trolley and the building mountings. Second, additional railway and a switching mechanism are added between the HNB#1 and #2 to access to the VVPSS components, which are newly added in the NB cell. Third, the mounting of the transversal beams supporting the dual rails onto the embedded plates are updated and further elaborated. Forth, the crane trolley is designed to have independent redundant kinematic chains so that it is recoverable from a single point failure. Fifth, series of braking systems such as a service brake, an auxiliary brake, and an emergency brake are integrated in each kinematic chain to cope with normal and accidental loads.

The remote maintenance of such a complex machine has impact on different aspects of the DTT machine: layout of the tokamak hall, vacuum vessel and cryostat structures, in–vessel components. To date, the number and size of vacuum vessel ports as well as the segmentation and size of in–vessel mechanical components of DTT have been established by a compromise between operational and maintenance needs. An extensive multidisciplinary work has been done in deriving the requirements for the DTT remote maintenance strategy. Each vacuum vessel sector is divided into five ports: in the current configuration, the top and bottom divertor cassettes are expected to be removed, respectively, from four lower lateral ports and from four equatorial horizontal ports; the first wall modules at the inboard side are expected to be installed/removed from all the upper ports; the first wall modules at the outboard and upper sides are segmented such that they can be removed from four equatorial horizontal ports.

Based on NRG's experience with nuclear risk analysis and Hot Cell procedures, early versions of these tool concepts and maintenance procedures were subjected to a HAZOP analysis. The analysis identified several weak points in the general upper port plug maintenance concept and led to clear recommendations on redesigns in port plug design, the operational sequence and ITER Hot Cell equipment. The paper describes the HAZOP methodology and illustrates its application with specific procedures: the Steering Mirror Assembly (SMA) replacement and the exchange of the Mid Shield Optics (MSO) in the ECH UPL.

This information comes from a review of the recent reports/papers about SDDR in ITER and own calculations. A total of 26 relevant pathways are found. The quality of these cross sections pathways is assessed following EAF validation procedure, and for those found as not validated last TENDL library versions have been investigated in order to check possible improvements when compared to EAF. The use of EAF libraries is found as trustworthy and it is recommended for the prediction of SDDR in the ITER PC and PI.

The scheduled and unscheduled maintenance times for the power core of fusion plants are extremely important as they directly determine the plant availability and, ultimately, the cost of electricity. The plant down time is determined by the time to access the failed or worn out part(s), the time to accomplish the replacement, and the time to verify the replacement. The ARIES-AT power core2 is the design basis for this comparison. One possible maintenance approach is the in-situ removal of moderate-sized modules of individual first wall, blanket, and divertor elements from inside the tokamak power core. This approach potentially allows smaller and lower cost toroidal and poloidal field coils that tightly fit around the outer surface of the power core shield or vacuum vessel. A second approach uses larger toroidal and poloidal field coils that will allow much larger ports to extract a complete, intact sector module of the first wall, blanket, shield, and divertor elements. The time to access and egress the power core components is largely determined by operations independent of the maintenance approach, such as reactor cool down, draining/filling fluids, unfastening/fastening doors, vacuum leak checks, etc. Replacement time of the core elements was found to significantly favor the modular sector approach because there are fewer and more accessible coolant and structural joints to unfasten and fasten. For the in-situ maintenance approach for ARIES-AT, there are more, but smaller, modules to handle than with the modular sector approach. Verification of the successful refurbishment is a distinct advantage for the modular sector approach because it can be operationally tested in a remote assembly area before being installed. Only a few main coolant connections will be verified within the power core region. For these reasons, the modular sector maintenance approach was adopted for the ARIES-AT conceptual design.",STRAT,ARIES,(general/none),2001,,Coolants; Fusion reactions; Fusion reactor divertors; Tokamak devices; Fusion power plants; Nuclear power plants,,American Nuclear Society,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035270491

During the first 10 years of ITER operation four different plasma scenarios will be used. Hence it will be possible to investigate the characteristics (e.g. tritium breeding performance) of different TBM concepts which will be installed during operation for the different phases of ITER operation in the equatorial ports #2, #16 and #18. In every port two TBMs will be accommodated, in the port #16 will be the European helium-cooled pebble bed blanket. In different phases of ITER operation different TBMs will be used. Therefore a complex maintenance process is necessary for the exchange of TBMs. Two TBMs are mounted onto one common frame, into a port plug (PP), which offers a standardised interface to the vacuum vessel (VV). It is cantilevered with a flange to VV port extension. This attachment system is the same in every equatorial port, so the exchange process of this structure with the TBMs is also the standard operation of ITER. Several components of the helium cooling system of the EU breeder modules, valves, pipes, gas mixers, thermal sleeves, pipes for tritium extraction, measurement system are integrated into the ancillary equipment unit (AEU), which during the operation will connect the port plug to the subsystems. The bigger part of the AEU is accommodated in the port cell and the rest part of it is penetrated into the interspace inside the bioshield and reach the back plane of the installed PP. The remote handling operations for connection/disconnection of an interface between the PP of the EU-TBMs and the AEU are investigated with the goal to reach a quick and simple TBM exchange procedure. The current design of the EU-TBMs foresees up to 18 supply lines for both TBMs. These lines have to be connected here. A new concept was worked out for fitting into each other these 18 pipe-ends and the opposite ones together at the same time in only one step before welding. A special mechanical system is developed, which can transfer the robot from its storing place in the AEU in the port cell to the interface on 6 m distance. This mechanism has a minimized space requirement, and able to send in the robot and all the tools stored in the tool-magazine together. Weld seams can be made by orbital welding tool (OWT). The coolant is helium, so for eliminating the leak of helium it is of high importance to find a safe way for weld seam audit. The installation and removal of thermal insulations around the pipes at the interface is an additional requirement which has to be met by a special tool. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here, the remote handling compatibility analysis (RHCA) of the GUPP design is presented that was performed for the GUPP final design review. The analysis focuses mainly on the insertion and extraction procedure of the diagnostic shield module (DSM), a removable cassette that contains the diagnostic in-vessel components. It is foreseen that the DSM is a replaceable component - the procedure of which is to be performed inside the ITER hot cell facility (HCF), where the GUPP can be oriented in a vertical position. The DSM removal procedure in the HCF consists of removing locking pins, an M30 sized shoulder bolt and two electrical straps through the use of a dexterous manipulator, after which the DSM is lifted out of the GUPP by an overhead crane. For optimum access to its internals, the DSM is mounted in a handling device. The insertion of a new or refurbished DSM follows the reverse procedure. The RHCA shows that the GUPP design requires a moderate amount of changes to become fully compatible with RH maintenance requirements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",SYS,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2014,Diagnostics; ITER; Port plug; Remote handling,Materials handling; Plasma diagnostics; Remote control; Compatibility analysis; Dexterous manipulators; Extraction procedure; In-vessel components; ITER; Maintenance requirement; Port plugs; Remote handling; Design,,Elsevier Ltd,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905909116

The need of deriving efficient vibration control strategies for a safe transportation of large and heavy payloads during maintenance procedures in nuclear fusion reactors is the main motivation behind this work. The approach shapes the reference motion command to the component such that the vibratory modes of the system are canceled. We perform the dynamic simulations of a large in-vessel component of the DEMOnstrating fusion power reactor during a remote handling operation. The simulations shows that the method is a possible solution to reduce the vibrations induced by the motion, in both the transient and residual phases. The benefits introduced by command shaping make the method promising towards building control framework for remote handling of in-vessel components in various tokamak devices.

The radiation prevents using live personnel for recovery purposes in the case of equipment malfunction and the fragile environment prevents using brute force to recover malfunctioning equipment. Due to these facts, the concept of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM) for the RH maintenance equipment is exceptionally valid. To improve the RCM concept, probabilistic methods based on the stochastic simulation and reliability mathematics are studied to add a degree of failure prediction. This paper describes the project to improve the reliability of remotely operated Water Hydraulic Manipulator (WHMAN) utilising probabilistic methods. This work was done on an FMECA (Failure Methods, Effects and Criticality Analysis) performed on the WHMAN prior to starting this project. Furthermore, additional considerations regarding maintenance regime derived from the results of this project are presented. © 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2011,ITER; Probabilistic approach; Reliability-Centered Maintenance; Remote Handling,Climate models; Equipment; Hydraulic machinery; Maintenance; Materials handling; Remote control; Stochastic models; Brute force; Criticality analysis; Failure prediction; ITER; Maintenance operations; Operational environments; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic methods; Reliability mathematics; Reliability-Centered Maintenance; Remote Handling; Runtimes; Stochastic simulations; System reliability; Water hydraulics; Reliability,Tekes,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054019926

These include the blankets themselves, the vacuum vessel (VV) and its ports and the Remote Maintenance System (RMS). Common challenges to any blanket attachment system have been identified, such as the need for applying a preload to the MMS manifold, the effects of the decay heat and several uncertainties related to permanent deformations when removing the blanket segments after service. The WP12 kinematics of the MMS in-vessel transportation was adapted to the requirements of each of the supports during 2013 and 2014 design activities. The RM equipment envisaged for handling attachments and earth connections may be composed of up to three different assemblies. An In-Vessel Mover at the divertor level handles the lower support and earth bonding, and could stabilize the MMS during transportation. A Shield Plug crane with a 6 DoF manipulator operates the upper attachment and earth straps. And a Vertical Maintenance Crane is responsible for the in-vessel MMS transportation and can handle the removable upper support pins. A final proposal is presented which can potentially reduce the number of required systems, at the same time that speeds-up the RMS global operations. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study concentrates on these issues. Effect of the noise caused by the slip ring has been estimated and it was confirmed that its effect is negligible. Detailed test plan for the control of cable handling system has been shown also. Regarding the signal transmission, it was confirmed that the 500-m distance transmission for the resolver is feasible with signal compensation by the voltage feedback circuit. Gamma-ray irradiation tests found that an operational amplifier, HS1-5104ARH-Q, functioned until total dose of 0.5 MGy. It is applicable for the ITER blanket remote handling system.

Despite other fusion machine requiring remote handling maintenance operations, DEMO is supposed to work under steady state operational conditions. Therefore, requirement on the maintenance scheme is stronger. To target a good availability of the machine along machine operation plan, it is necessary to draw an adequate maintenance scheme. Indeed, due to the high fluxes generated by the plasma in the vacuum vessel, the first wall lifetime is limited, so the frequent replacement is necessary. On current fusion experimental machine, as first wall load conditions are less severe, DEMO condition implies high level of requirement on maintenance time. During DEMO lifetime, several full first wall replacements are expected. To provide access to the vacuum vessel machine for first wall removal, preparatory work is required to set the machine to adequate maintenance conditions and to open the machine properly, the same situation at the end of the maintenance period. Shutdown duration for first wall replacement should be as short as possible to reach the availability target of the machine. From this statement, the maintenance duration should not exceed 20% of the total lifetime of the reactor operation. First wall segmentation (i.e. total number of component to replace) has a high impact onto the replacement time. Considering the number of feasible designs for the first wall segmentation, we concentrate remote handling concept assessments one type of segmentation, the one minimizing the numbers of modules to replace [ITER technical basis; G A0 FDR 1 01-07-13 R1.0, Plant Description Document, Chapter 2.9; Remote handling at http://www.iter.org; ITER Conceptual Design Report, IAEA/ITER/DS/18, IAEA, Vienna, 1991; ITER Final Design Report, G A0 FDR 4 01-06-28 R 0.2, July 2001]. Assumption on Divertor segmentation for these DEMO studies have similarities with Divertor ITER design; therefore ITER design output is relevant [G. Janeschitz, A. Antipenkov, G. Federici, C.

In this work we develop a retro-reflective marker-based version of 3D Node that estimates the pose of a planar target, the knuckle of the divertor cassette locking system, using the markers attached to its surface. We demonstrate a pin-tool insertion task using these methods. Results show that our approach works reliably with a single low-resolution camera and outperforms the previously researched stereo depth estimation based approaches.

This was a demanding and challenging activity which was based on the experience gained from a period of over 15 years (20,000 h operations) of JET In-Vessel remote handling operations. This paper describes the difference between estimated remote handling in-vessel durations and those actually achieved with a view to quantifying the typical disparity between them. There are many factors that affect productivity of the remote handling operations and it is important to accommodate these either in the design of the component or within the production of the operational procedures with a view to minimise all impact on the final task duration. Some factors that affect the efficiency are outside the control of the design and operational procedures. These are unforeseen anomalies that were encountered during the removal, naked wall survey and installation of the components. Recoveries from these anomalies are extremely challenging and need to be addressed efficiently in order to minimise the impact on the shutdown duration and prevent optimised panned activities from becoming inefficient by fragmentation. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",EXP,JET,BLANKET,2013,Productivity; Remote handling,Productivity; Remote control; Operational procedures; Remote handling; Materials handling,"H2020 Euratom, EURATOM; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/I501045/1)",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884973806

In this article, an open software architecture developed for the EAST articulated maintenance arm (EAMA) is described, which offers a robust and proper performance and easy-going experience based on standard open robotic platform OROCOS. The paper presents a component-based model software architecture using multi-layer structure: end layer, up layer, middle, and down layer. In the end layer the components are defined off-line in the task planner manner. The components in up layer complete the function of trajectory plan. The CORBA, as a communication framework, is adopted to exchange the data between the distributed components. The contributors use Real-Time Workshop from the MATLAB/Simulink to generate the components in the middle layer. Real-time Toolkit guarantees control applications running in the hard real-time mode. Ethernets and the CAN bus are used for data transfer in the down layer, where the components implement the hardware functions.

By applying our procedure preventive maintenance increased the availability of the ITER blanket remote handling system from 46% to 88%, while the expected number of total failures was reduced from 5.5 to 1.6.

Since in-vessel remote handling systems must operate under intense gamma ray radiation exceeding 30 kGy/h, their components must have sufficiently high radiation hardness to allow maintenance long enough in ITER in-vessel environments. Thus, extensive radiation tests and quality improvement, including optimization of material compositions, have been conducted through the ITER R&D program to develop radiation hardness components that meet radiation doses from 10 to 100 MGy at 10 kGy/h. This paper presents the latest on radiation hardness component development conducted by the Japan Home Team as a contribution to the ITER. The remote handling components tested are categorized for use in robotic or viewing systems, or as common components. Radiation tests have been conducted on commercially available products for screening, on modified products, and on new products to improve the radiation hardness. © 1998, Fuji Technology Press.

To handle the 9 Tonne divertor cassette, water hydraulics has been selected because it offers high forces and precise control in a compact envelope, with minimal long-term contamination should a leak develop. Water hydraulic components use mainly stainless steel - unaffected by gamma radiation - but the integral seals and O-rings are known to be sensitive. For radiation testing of these components, a modular approach was adopted, enabling up to 11 seal carriers assemblies to be irradiated simultaneously in the limited space available, with individual carriers being removed at varying total doses up to 10 MGy. Each carrier was then installed in a real hydraulic rig for testing, revealing not only at what total dose the components became unusable, but also how they fail, enabling condition monitoring to assess the state of the seals long before their failure might render the RH equipment irrecoverable. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The Port Cell clearing process is a complex, manual and machine assisted procedure, taking out the equipment blocking cask access in several stages. For the Equatorial Launcher (EL) of the Electron Cyclotron Heating (ECH) system, which is located in Equatorial Port Cell #14 of the ITER tokamak, the Port Cell clearing operation includes the removal of 24 Ex-vessel Waveguides, a complex set of CCWS (component cooling) and PHTS (primary cooling) lines, several manifolds, and other ancillaries, like the Service Vacuum System (SVS) to monitor the torus vacuum tightness. This paper shows how modern Virtual Reality (VR) simulation techniques, in combination with a state of the art, high-end game-PC environment and Head Mounted Display, can be used as a tool to visualize and analyse the maintenance procedures, to predict the time to repair, and to assist in minimizing radiation exposure to take in to consideration the ALARA principles. Special emphasis is put on the verification and validation of manual and machine-assisted maintenance procedures and the identification of tooling requirements. The possibility to simulate logistics and repair actions in an early stage of the design process allows for the identification of those maintenance actions that require dedicated tests or the development of dedicated tools. The added value of using modern VR techniques to analyse the maintenance scenarios are: • Immersive & intuitive – very little training required to experience the process first-hand • Quick and accurate assessment of maintenance scenarios, based on the actual CATIA models • The ability to assess in detail geometrically very complex maintenance sequencing • Less need for expensive hardware mock ups © 2023",SOFT,ITER,RF-HCD,2023,ALARA; ECH; ITER; Maintenance; Port cell; Virtual reality,Cyclotrons; Cytology; Helmet mounted displays; Repair; Tokamak devices; Virtual reality; ALARA; Electron-cyclotron heatings; Hot Cell; ITER; Maintenance procedures; Maintenance scenario; Port cell; Port plugs; Transport casks; Virtual reality techniques; Cells,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85154558787

The key devices to carry out these operations are the (CMM), Cassette Toroidal Mover, Multi Axis Manipulators (MAM) and related tooling. Despite their differences, in essence all of these devices are manipulators with varying specifications. Hence, from the operator's point of view, they perform similar operations, such as following predefined position trajectories and lifting and carrying tools and equipment. This paper explores how to implement a software framework for a Command and Control application, otherwise known as Human Machine Interface (HMI), in such a way that it could be used to control different manipulators. A framework is presented that supports the combining of small, independent modules into a single cohesive HMI. It is then shown that a HMI can be built by combining modules that are common to these manipulators and modules that are specific to a single manipulator. This will not only minimize the programming effort but also reduce the training required of operators. To elaborate on the concept, an example HMI is implemented to control virtual models of CMM and MAM. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In past years, the physical parameters and related engineering design of subsystems were modified, evaluated and redesigned for several rounds in order to fulfill the final scientific goals. Remote maintenance (RM) is identified as one of the key issues of the CFETR because of the neutron activation of the in-vessel components. Different schemes were proposed and comparatively assessed to reach the best possible tradeoff between RM strategies and Tokamak machine designs. This paper will give an overall introduction of the latest version of RM strategy and system conceptual design based on current physical configuration with 16 toroidal field coils and larger sizes. In general, modular blanket components will be removed through only two large vertical maintenance ports while two lower horizontal ports are employed for divertor removing. The work has also provided guidelines for compatibility consideration such as the blanket and divertor modularity, the cryostat pipe arrangement, and the corridor layout to hot cell. In addition, some innovative RM system design for the blanket and divertor maintenance was also provided in the paper, such as the implementation of a toroidal mover transferring blankets to vertical ports, and the novel cask design ensuring storing six divertor at the same time. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",STRAT,CFETR,BLANKET DIVERTOR CRYO TRANSPORT,2020,CFETR; Compatibility; Fusion reactor; Remote maintenance; Tokamak design,Conceptual design; Fusion reactor divertors; Machine design; Engineering design; Fusion Engineering; In-vessel components; Neutron activation; Physical parameters; Remote maintenance; Remote maintenance system; Toroidal Field coils; Maintenance,"Shenzhen Clean Energy Research Institute; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11802305); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST, (2017YFE0300503); Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología, MICYT",Springer,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084158111

Main features of the proposal are as follows: (1) structures made of concrete are employed to support the weight of the injectors; (2) each injector can be separated into two units: ion source unit and beamline unit; (3) since the ion source is considered to require frequent maintenance, each ion source unit can be removed independently of the other ion source units, by means of rail-and-truck system; (4) double door concept is adopted in two large gate valves to prevent spreading of the radioactivated contamination; (5) laser welding/cutting technique and shape memory alloy are utilized to ease connection/disconnection of pipes, cables, etc.; (6) if any failure occurrs in an ion source unit or a beamline unit, the unit will be transferred to a hot cell. Then the unit will be disassembled and the failed components will be repaired in the cell. Considering these concepts, maintenance scenarios are worked out for four cases; ion source unit disassembly/assembly, and beamline unit diassembly/assembly. © 1991.",STRAT,ITER,NBI,1991,,,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149143712

However, the medium in traditional hydraulic system is mineral oil, in the nuclear environment they are dangerous in case of leakage and activate.

After the transition, the neutron detectors were experimentally recalibrated as different materials have vastly different neutron transport properties and thus big changes in the material composition can significantly affect the responses of the neutron monitors. During the experimental campaign, the JET remote handling system (RHS) positioned a 252Cf neutron source to more than 200 positions inside the tokamak, but this being a massive system, its effects on the neutron monitors had to be evaluated. For the purpose of evaluation, we developed a simplified MCNP model of the RHS and, in order to generate the input files for all the neutron source positions more easily, a program that translates the RHS movement data into the transformations, positioning individual parts of the RHS to the correct positions in the model. To ensure that the movements of our model correspond to those of the actual RHS, we performed a series of tests including visual benchmarks at certain positions and comparison of the positions of the neutron source, provided by the RHS operators, with the positions calculated using our program. After the required agreement between the positions was achieved, we were able to calculate the effect that the RHS has on the neutron monitors and also provide some feedback to the RHS operators in order to decrease the aforementioned effect.",SOFT,JET,IN-VESSEL,2015,JET remote handling system; MCNP model,Fighter aircraft; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Monte Carlo methods; Neutron detectors; Neutron sources; Nuclear reactors; Remote control; Software testing; Tokamak devices; Transport properties; Experimental campaign; First wall materials; Joint European Torus; Massive systems; Material compositions; Neutron monitors; Neutron transport; Remote handling system; Neutrons,,American Nuclear Society,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949504260

Consequently, the means of recovery of remote handling systems in fusion reactors must be well-established. The ITER Blanket Remote Handling System will use an auxiliary rescue tool, which is introduced into the vacuum vessel and then remotely positioned to drive any failed joint. This paper presents the design and test results of a prototype rescue tool for the ITER Blanket Remote Handling System. We designed a rescue tool having compliant mechanisms to provide six degrees of freedom. The compliant mechanisms are completely passive to keep the tool simple and reliable. Testing of a prototype rescue tool by using a manipulator to simulate the remote environment, we found that our rescue tool is capable of being positioned remotely using a robot vision system owing to the compliant mechanism, which can absorb positioning error up to up to 4 mm in translation, 4° in pitch and yaw, and 2.5° in roll. Therefore, we conclude our rescue tool can be applied as the means of recovery for the ITER Blanket Remote Handling System. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,ITER,BLANKET REMOTE,2019,Failure; Recovery; Remote handling; Rescue,Compliant mechanisms; Computer system recovery; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Fusion reactors; Manipulators; Mechanisms; Recovery; Remote control; Design and tests; Positioning error; Remote environment; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Rescue; Robot vision systems; Six degrees of freedom; Materials handling,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064222512

Such devices are CMM, CTM and WHMAN to assist CMM and CTM. These devices execute complex and safety-critical operations while supporting ITER reactor elements weighting several tons. Despite the differences in the load capacity and functionality, the control system of these devices can be categorized as position servo control or force servo control. In this paper we propose the use of unified software development approach currently developed and demonstrated at the DTP2. This new approach takes into account the ITER RH requirements for all maintenance devices, not only the water-hydraulic maintenance devices. The need for extensive software verification and validation utilizing international standards for safety-critical systems is addressed. This applies both to control software architecture and user interface design. In principle, we propose that all ITER maintenance devices are developed and tested with the common software architecture and user interface. This makes it possible to reuse generic software modules that are well documented and tested, resulting decreased verification and validation period and development cost. Utilising this approach also improves reliability and safety of the maintenance operations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, the ITER Blanket Remote Handling System (BRHS) will be deployed into the VV to stably handle the blanket modules 1.5 m long, weighing up to 4.5 ton with high positioning accuracy. The BRHS itself must also undergo regular hands-on decontamination and maintenance in the Hot Cell Facility (HCF). However, the workers will be exposed to any activated dust that remains on BRHS component surfaces after remote decontamination. Past studies estimated the contaminated surface area of the BRHS, however, in this study, decontamination tests were performed and the dose rate to maintenance workers was calculated using the Monte Carlo N–Particle Transport Code (MCNP5). Decontamination tests were performed by using multiple test pieces of varying surface roughness made from SUS329J4L and two different types of brushes (nylon and SUS304) to simulate decontamination of the BRHS surface. Tungsten dust was pressed on the test pieces to simulate the loading by the rollers. After the test pieces were brushed the surface of each test piece was observed by using both optical and scanning electron microscopes. Dust was reduced by approximately 99% in all cases where the SUS304 brush was used regardless of surface roughness. The decontamination rate was used to estimate how much dust will be able to be cleaned from the BRHS surface. This paper describes the optimal decontamination tools with respect to the BRHS surface conditions to calculate and hopefully reduce the dose rate to maintenance workers so as to optimize the BRHS maintenance plan in the HCF. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",ASSESS,ITER,BLANKET REMOTE,2019,Decontamination; ITER Blanket Remote Handling System; Radioactive dust; Remote maintenance,Decontamination; Dust; Maintenance; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Radiation decontamination; Radioactivity; Remote control; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface roughness; Contaminated surfaces; Maintenance plans; Maintenance workers; Particle transport codes; Positioning accuracy; Remote handling system; Remote maintenance; Surface conditions; Surface testing,Hitachi Power Solutions Co.

As identified in the EFDA Roadmap to the realisation of Fusion Energy, 2013: “The integration of the Remote Maintenance system within the DEMO plant is an essential task within the DEMO CDA phase. This will involve establishing requirements, functions and interfaces with many other systems to ensure that plant availability and maintainability are considered from the outset.” In order to fulfil this integration requirement different geometries of DEMO have been assessed for their impact on remote maintenance (RM). The aspect ratio and number of TF coils have been identified as the pivotal variables, driving the tokamak geometry, with significant effects on remote maintenance both in terms of technical feasibility and speed of operation. Tokamak geometries with aspect ratios from 2.6 to 4.0 and 16 or 18 TF coils have been compared. The results of this evaluation show that higher aspect ratios and lower numbers of TF coils are beneficial to RM both in terms of technical feasibility and speed of operations. To deliver a maintainable DEMO, efforts must be made to maximize its aspect ratio and minimize the number of TF coils. © 2017 The Author(s)",SYS,DEMO,COILS (general/none),2017,Holistic design; Integration; Optimization; Remote maintenance; Systems engineering; Tokamak geometry,Conceptual design; Geometry; Integration; Maintenance; Optimization; Systems engineering; Tokamak devices; Different geometry; Fusion energy; Holistic design; Integration requirements; Plant availability; Remote maintenance; Remote maintenance system; Tokamak geometry; Aspect ratio,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018728672

These cassettes shall be removed/installed remotely during the life of the reactor by means of specific devices. To demonstrate and optimise the feasibility of the in-vessel maintenance process the Divertor Test Platform (DTP) has been established at the ENEA Research Centre in Brasimone, Italy, as a major part of the large ITER R&D project L7. A first set of tests has been already carried out and reported during 1998, when the basic feasibility of the divertor replacement was demonstrated. In the present period (January 1999-July 2000), new activities, including both site tests and other ""external"" R&D works, have been carried out in order to refine and improve the ITER divertor maintenance scenario. These include the study of abnormal maintenance operations and of possible handling equipment failure and its consequences; the procurement and testing of new sub-systems (e.g. a force reflection manipulator arm), and the development of remote handling techniques including a virtual reality system. Following a short description of the DTP, this paper reports on the new results and achievements, draws the relevant conclusions, and finally discusses future activities. © 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.",FAC,ITER,DIVERTOR,2001,Divertor remote maintenance; Divertor test platform programme; ITER R&D,Experimental reactors; Maintenance; Manipulators; Research and development management; Vacuum; Virtual reality; Divertor test platform (DTP); Fusion reactor divertors,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-14244270981

Remote handling (RH) is one of the most important ways for maintenance of CFETR Blanket. The RH is composed of two manipulators, auxiliary manipulator is used for cooling water pipe cutting and welding, while main manipulator is design to carry heavy components such as blanket through the upper port relying on positioning accuracy and reliability. This paper presents how the main manipulator can be more precision to optimize the safety of RH tasks. The paper also discusses an effective way to optimize the design and analysis of the main manipulator. The results show that the optimization of the water hydraulic manipulator makes a significant contribution to the R&D of the RH of CFETR. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",HARD,CFETR,BLANKET,2015,Blanket maintenance; Remote handling; Water hydraulics,Conceptual design; Cooling water; Engineering research; Maintenance; Materials handling; Nuclear reactors; Remote control; Water pipelines; Cooling water pipe; Design and analysis; Fusion Engineering; IS design; Positioning accuracy; Remote handling; Water hydraulics; Manipulators,"National Magnetic Confinement Fusion Program of China, (2011GB114000, 2014GB101004)",Springer New York LLC,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939956405

The lifecycle of the IRMS will largely exceed 40 years from initial concept design and proof testing through to machine decommissioning. Such a long lifecycle requires that a rigorous approach is put in place to guarantee the technical capabilities of the highly innovative IRMS, its efficiency and its availability. For this purpose, an IRMS System Engineering and IRMS lifecycle management approach has been adopted by ITER. The approach aims at ensuring the IRMS full operability and availability at an acceptable cost of ownership over the full ITER machine assembly and operations period. The IRMS lifecycle management method described in this paper covers such subjects as specific requirements for IRMS design reviews, monitoring during manufacture, factory and site acceptance testing, integrated commissioning, decontamination, maintenance and re-qualification strategies, requirements for Integrated Logistical Support during operations. The updating and implementation of the IRMS lifecycle strategy and this procedure will be managed and monitored by the Remote Handling Integrated Product Team (RH-IPT). Although developed for the IRMS, the basic principles and procedures of lifecycle management could be applied to other ITER plant systems whose reliability and availability will be essential for the continued operation of the ITER machine. © 2011 ITER Organization.

Evaluating the dynamic response of the system is of essential importance because the BRHS has various configurations with the flexible articulated rail system and vehicle manipulators that move along the rail. In addition, the floor response spectrum in the vertical direction at the equatorial ports has a steep peak at ∼8 Hz due to dynamic amplification of the building therefore understanding the natural modes and frequencies is indispensable to verify the structural design. This paper reports the seismic analysis of the BRHS during blanket module handling operation. A dynamic global FE model analysis to specify the unfavorable configurations of the system via parametric study, and local FE model analyses to verify the structural strength of critical components using interface loads obtained from the global analysis were done. The seismic resistance of the BRHS was studied and the structural design confirmed.

One of the key technical challenges to implement a high payload RH system is its rotary joints that should be able to handle various in-vessel components having both high and small payload and requiring high precision within a constrained in-vessel space. In addition, it needs to withstand seismic loads, high radiation, to get low contamination during maintenance operation, and to be easily decontaminated. This article presents the design and analysis results of one of the key rotary joints that takes the most significant cantilever loading within a tight space constraint, which is the first rolling joint. Design requirements of the rotary joint are investigated considering its normal operation, seismic event, failure conditions, and recovery operations. The configuration having three-stage reducers and three independent servomotors is selected. The final-stage gearbox that takes the highest loading is designed by using cycloid gears which are driven by second-stage planetary gears whose sun gear is driven by the three independent geared servo motors. Mechanical design is carried out to fit into the available space within the rotary joint body frame. Finite element analysis is performed to assess the deformation and stress of the rotary joint body frame and the cycloid gear internal components. The analysis result shows that the rotary joint is feasible to cope with the required loading conditions. © 1973-2012 IEEE.",HARD,CFETR,IN-VESSEL,2020,China fusion engineering test reactor (CFETR); cycloid gearbox; design requirements; high payload; remote handling (RH); rotary joint; three-stage reducers,Epicyclic gears; Materials handling; Nuclear reactors; Remote control; Seismology; Cantilever loading; Deformation and stress; Design and analysis; Failure conditions; In-vessel components; Maintenance operations; Remote handling system; Technical challenges; Seismic design,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086703489

The manipulator comprises a closed-chain main body and an open-chain end-effector. Following a systematic way of analyzing differential kinematics and vibration modes, it is revealed that from a control point of view the manipulator faces two main restrictions. The first one is that the closed-chain structure degrades tracking performances, rising from kinematic coupling. Secondly, as the end-effector drives a very high inertial load instead of a gravitational load, small actuators are used, resulting in low system natural frequency and damping. To solve the first issue, a kinematic model-based decoupling controller is designed. Moreover, to improve the steady-state accuracy in spite of low frequency and damping, acceleration feedback is adopted, achieving higher damping and position loop gains. Experimental results show that decoupling controller brings five times smaller tracking errors, while acceleration feedback controller reaches three times better accuracies than proportional controller. This study also confirms that in spite of using commercially available water hydraulic components, the achieved positioning accuracies and dynamic behavior are competitive with oil hydraulics. © 2010 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",HARD,ITER,DIVERTOR,2010,Coupling; Hydraulic manipulator; ITER; Kinematic model-based decoupling; Vibration mode analysis,Chains; Controllers; Couplings; Damping; End effectors; Experimental reactors; Kinematics; Manipulators; Multivariable control systems; Nuclear reactors; Tokamak devices; Vibration analysis; Decoupling controllers; Differential kinematics; Hydraulic manipulator; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; ITER; Kinematic model; Proportional controller; Vibration mode analysis; Feedback,EURA-TOM; Tekes,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950372605

However, as radiation levels increase, so too will the number of maintenance tasks that must be performed without human access. To meet these conflicting constraints, remote maintenance systems must therefore significantly increase their capabilities, performing tasks faster and in parallel. Unfortunately, the current teleoperation-based maintenance approach is inherently limited in these regards. Automation emerges as a potential solution, having demonstrated dramatic productivity gains in manufacturing across the world. The European DEMO project has begun to explore the feasibility of automated maintenance as a route to meeting the challenging availability targets. To this end, the Automated Inspection and Maintenance Test Unit (AIM-TU) has been designed and constructed, providing a highly versatile test platform able to adapt to evolving R&D programmes. It consists of a modular robot cell equipped with two robot arms mounted on linear rails, interchangeable end-of-arm-tooling, a variety of vision sensors and a fully integrated safety system. The hardware is supported by a modular software architecture, which permits different control input modes and provides a digital twin simulation of the cell for virtual verification and validation of control algorithms. This paper provides an overview of the system's capabilities and reports on the first automated maintenance feasibility tests performed on the cell: automatic replacement of JET reactor tiles and automatic contactless inspection of tile anomalies. © 2021 The Authors",FAC AUTO,DEMO,(general/none),2021,Automation; Maintenance; Remote; Robotics,Computer software; Inspection; Maintenance; Plant shutdowns; Productivity; Automated inspection; Automated maintenance; Feasibility testing; Fusion power plant; Inspection and maintenance; Maintenance shutdowns; Maintenance tasks; Radiation levels; Remote; Test unit; Automation,"Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103687812

Dust that adheres to the top surface of the BRHS rail from cyclic loading of the vehicle manipulator is considered to be the most difficult dust to remove. Dust removal experiments were conducted to simulate the materials, conditions, and cyclic loading of actual BRHS operations. The tungsten powder used to simulate the dust was squashed, and the area of contact by cyclic load was increased, but the powder was not embedded into the matrix. The increase in the area of contact increased the total intermolecular force between a tungsten particle and the surface, which was considered the main force adhering dust to the test piece surface. A combination of dust removal methods, including vacuum cleaning and brushing, was applied to the simulated dust that adhered to the test pieces. The results showed that vacuum cleaning is effective in removing dust from the non-cyclic loaded surface. The combined methods were highly efficient in removing the dust that strongly adhered to the rail surface. © 2014 The Japan Society of Plasma Science and Nuclear Fusion Research.",ASSESS STRAT,ITER,BLANKET,2014,Activated dust; Blanket remote handling system; Dust removal method; ITER,Chemical bonds; Cleaning; Cyclic loads; Dust control; Materials handling; Materials handling equipment; Remote control; Tungsten; Combined method; Dust removal; Inter-molecular forces; ITER; Maintenance workers; Remote handling system; Tungsten powders; Vacuum cleaning; Dust,,Japan Society of Plasma Science and Nuclear Fusion Research,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988353471

The aim of this paper is to decrease the neutron leakage as a mean to eventually reduce the activation relevant for shutdown dose rates. The performance of the neutron shielding assembled in the baseline model of the Remote Handling Lower Port rack has been assessed. As a mitigation strategy, neutronics calculations have been conducted to evaluate the radiation field during operation in the lower port with the Remote Handling Lower Port rack and the interspace components installed. A progressive improvement of the neutron shielding has been carried out with additional shielding elements including a large shielding block. As a result, the neutron streaming has been significantly reduced along the lower port with a neutron fluence rate in the closure flange in the range of 1·109 n/cm2s to 1·108 n/cm2s. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",ASSESS,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2018,ITER; MCNP; Neutronics; Remote Handling – Lower Port Rack; Shielding,Materials handling; Radiation shielding; Remote control; Shielding; ITER; MCNP; Mitigation strategy; Neutron fluence rate; Neutron shielding; Neutron streaming; Neutronics; Remote handling; Neutrons,"ITER, (4200001696)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049936328

Standard maintenance procedures for cassette removal include connection/disconnection operations of the cassette body from the reactor frame. Remote handling (R.H.) means are therefore required to remove the electrical connector and cut/weld the cassette cooling pipes. Evolutions of ITER design focused on a reduction of the divertor cooling pipes from the initial 6 in. straight pipes to 2.5 in. bent pipes. As a consequence of this new definition, the initial maintenance scheme where maintenance is completely performed from the inside of the pipe by one carrier becomes obsolete. A solution based on the cooperative work between a carrier sent into the pipe to perform part of the maintenance operations and an orbital tool positioned by a manipulator mounted on the Cassette Toroidal Mover (CTM) has been devised. A reference working area is defined and used to perform CAD simulations with a manipulator model. Work area accessibility is assessed using a virtual cutting/welding orbital tool. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In order to provide the multi-machining-function as well as the complicated, flexible and customizable GUI designing satisfying the non-standardized VV assembly process in one hand, and in another hand guarantee the stringent machining precision in the real-time motion control of robot machine, a client-server-control software architecture is proposed, which separates the user interaction, data communication and robot control implementation into different software layers. Correspondingly, three particular application protocols upon the TCP/IP are designed to transmit the data, command and status between the client and the server so as to deal with the abundant data streaming in the software. In order not to be affected by the graphic user interface (GUI) modification process in the future experiment in VV assembly working field, the real-time control system is realized as a stand-alone module in the architecture to guarantee the controlling performance of the robot machine.

This paper introduces a novel remote handling robot (RHR) for the maintenance of ITER-like D-shaped vessel. The modular designed RHR, which is an important part of the remote handling system for ITER, consists of three parts: an omnidirectional transfer vehicle (OTV), a planar articulated arm (PAA), and an articulated teleoperated manipulator (ATM). The task of RHR is to carry processing tools, such as the viewing system, leakage detector, and electric screwdriver, to inspect and maintain the components installed inside the D-shaped vessel. The kinematics of the OTV, as well as the kinematic analyses of the PAA and ATM, is studied in this paper. Because of its special length and heavy payload, the dynamics of the PAA is also investigated through a dynamic simulation system based on robot technology middleware (RTM). The results of the path planning, workspace simulations, and dynamic simulation indicate that the RHR has good mobility together with satisfying kinematic and dynamic performances and can well accomplish its maintenance tasks in the ITER-like D-shaped vessel. © 2014 Peihua Chen and Qixin Cao.",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2014,,Aerospace vehicles; Electric tools; Kinematics; Maintenance; Materials handling; Middleware; Motion planning; Remote control; Robots; Dynamic performance; Dynamic simulation systems; Electric screwdrivers; ITER vacuum vessels; Kinematic Analysis; Remote handling system; Remote maintenance; Robot technology middlewares; Tokamak devices,,Hindawi Limited,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934945955

With high temperature, vacuum and radiation levels, the environment inside the tokamak is hostile to human beings. All the repair and maintenance tasks are handled by specialized Remote Handling (RH) equipment consisting of robotic manipulators, special tooling and deployment systems which are controlled by skilled RH operators. These RH equipment are integrated using a supervisory control architecture in which the control system is distributed into operator level and machine level control systems. The OROCOS real-Time toolkit, available open source, is used to implement the equipment controller that encompasses the machine-level control system software and hardware for operating multi-joint programmable RH equipment devices. It provides a standard interface and insulates the operator level control system from details of low-level hardware. The communication between operator and machine level systems is achieved at 100Hz through a standard middleware. This paper presents the detailed implementation of the equipment controller with the operator level & machine level interfaces and its successful implementation for controlling the articulated RH equipment having 25 Kg payload with a toroidal reach of ~2m and a 6 DOF industrial robot. The master control is achieved using a commercial haptic device. A novel concept of virtual move is also implemented for carrying out offline simulations. The performance tests show low latency and smooth control over the RH equipment. © 2017 ACM.",SOFT,(none),(general/none),2017,Haptic feedback; OROCOS; Remote handling; Repair and maintenance; Tokamak; Virtual reality,Computer operating systems; Control systems; Equipment; Haptic interfaces; Hardware; Level control; Leveling (machinery); Magnetoplasma; Maintenance; Manipulators; Materials handling; Middleware; Open source software; Open systems; Remote control; Repair; Robotics; Tokamak devices; Virtual reality; Haptic feedbacks; OROCOS; Remote handling; Repair and maintenance; Tokamak; Controllers,,Association for Computing Machinery,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038438757

In the present reactor concept, the relevant key components are the divertor cassettes, located in the lower region of the vacuum vessel. Due to erosion and damage to the divertor plasma facing components, estimated scheduled replacement of the cassettes will be required eight times during the machine lifetime. Moreover, for such an experimental tokamak where completely new plasma regimes will be established, unscheduled interventions cannot be excluded a priori. To test and optimize the divertor maintenance scenario, the so called ITER L7 R&D project has been realized at the ENEA Brasimone laboratories, with a full scale simulation of the in-vessel cassette maintenance environment and of the hot cell refurbishment operations. The basic demonstration of the validity of the current scenario has been established, and now new activities are in progress to optimize many aspects of the operations (procedures, hardware improvements, reliability, etc.). Based on the background and the results of these activities, this paper discusses the lessons learned during the project implementation, and identifies key points of the current strategy that should be maintained for any new design of ITER or an `ITER-like' reactor.",OVER FAC,ITER,DIVERTOR,2000,,Computer simulation; Optimization; Preventive maintenance; Vacuum applications; Hot cell refurbishment operations; In-vessel cassette maintenance environment; Tokamak devices,,Elsevier Sequoia SA,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034317383

Mirrors provided as identical in the same batch by the manufacturer, have very different reflectivities in the UV range, analysis of the surface material has shown varying amounts of SiO and SiO2 for nominally SiO overcoating. In another case the specified coating (MgF2) for an UV enhanced mirror was observed to contain Hf, neither Mg nor F were found. Hf is commonly used to enhance the reflectivity in the UV spectral range, but Hf has a large low energy neutron capture cross-section and may cause problems due to transmutation.

These RH tools are designed to remove and replace the rupture disk assembly and the bleed line valve assembly, to clean the relief lines, and to perform any associated operations to maintain them. The RH tools work together with the Neutral Beam Remote Handling System (NBRHS). The main functions of the RH tools are disconnection and connection of the bolted flanges, keeping the static confinement during the RH operations, limiting the spread of contamination, and vacuum or water jet cleaning of the contamination inside the relief line. The RH interfaces in the components are defined during the design process of the RH tools in collaboration with the VVPSS component designers. An RH sequence study is being carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the maintenance operations within the constrained NB cell environment, and the capability of the NBRHS. © 2021",STRAT,ITER,IN-VESSEL NBI,2021,ITER; Neutral beam cell; Remote handling; VVPSS,Materials handling equipment; Particle beams; Remote control; Handling tools; ITER; Neutral beam cell; Neutral beams; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Suppression systems; Vacuum vessel; Vacuum vessel pressure suppression system; Vessel pressure; Materials handling,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115893467

The defined segmentation, general arrangement and maintenance approach for the vacuum vessel blankets has a major impact on the overall device configuration. The K-DEMO blanket arrangement is centered on an approach to minimize the number of blanket segments that are accessed through vertical maintenance ports. Minimizing the segment number reduces the number of piping services that interface with it and exit the vacuum vessel. The defined design of interfacing components was made to enhance this plan. Concept design details of the prescribed K-DEMO machine configuration have evolved in sufficient detail to allow the merits (or shortcomings) of this design approach to be evaluated with respect to other blanket segmentation and maintenance options. Coupled with the designed in-vessel blanket arrangement and maintenance approach a conceptual design of an intermediary maintenance enclosure above the machine core has been developed to interface, handle and move a blanket sector from the device core through the vertical ports without using an individual cask enclosure located at each vertical port opening. The results of this activity along with an overview of the latest K-DEMO general arrangement will be presented. © 2019",SYS,DEMO,BLANKET,2019,Blanket segmentation; Device availability; Device general arrangement; K-DEMO; Remote maintenance,Availability; Conceptual design; Enclosures; Concept designs; Demo blankets; Design approaches; Design definition; Device configurations; General arrangement; Maintenance approaches; Remote maintenance; Maintenance,"U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE, (DE-AC02-09CH11466); Princeton University; National Fusion Research Institute, NFRI",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062430370

These components, by virtue of their design and location, require a versatile yet comprehensive suite of remote handling tools to undertake their in-vessel installation. The installation of the various diagnostic components is covered in multiple tasks. Each task requires careful assessment and design of tools that can successfully interface with the components and comply with the handling and installation requirements. With remote maintenance a requirement, the looms/conduits were designed to be modular with connections which are electrically connected when the module is fitted or conversely disconnected when removed. The shape of each complex and often bulky component is verified during the design phase, to ensure that it can be delivered and installed to its specified location in the torus.

Before ITER can be put into operation, safety regulations and licensing authorities require proof of maintainability for critical components. Part of the proof will come from using standard components and procedures. Additional verification and validation is based on simulation and hardware tests in 1:1 scale mockups. The Master Slave manipulator system (MS2) Benchmark Product was designed to implement a reference set of maintenance tasks representative for ITER remote handling. Experiments were performed with two versions of the Benchmark Product. In both experiments, the quality of visual feedback varied by exchanging direct view with indirect view (using video cameras) in order to measure and analyze its impact on human task performance. The first experiment showed that both experienced and novice RH operators perform a simple task significantly better with direct visual feedback than with camera feedback. A more complex task showed a large variation in results and could not be completed by many novice operators. Experienced operators commented on both the mechanical design and visual feedback. In a second experiment, a more elaborate task was tested on an improved Benchmark product. Again, the task was performed significantly faster with direct visual feedback than with camera feedback. In post-test interviews, operators indicated that they regarded the lack of 3D perception as the primary factor hindering their performance. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The positions of the poloidal field (PF) coil are limited by the size of the toroidal field (TF) coil and the maintenance port layout of each remote maintenance scheme. Because the PF coils are located near the larger TF coil and far from the plasma surface, the horizontal sector transport maintenance scheme requires the largest part of total PF coil current, 25% larger than that required for separated sector transport using vertical maintenance ports with segmented divertor maintenance (SDM). In the unsegmented divertor maintenance (UDM) scheme, the total magnetic stored energy in the PF coils at plasma equilibrium is about 30% larger than that stored in the SDM scheme, but the time required for removal and installation of all the divertor cassettes in the UDM scheme is roughly a third of that required in the SDM scheme because the number of divertor cassettes in the UDM scheme is a third of that in the SDM scheme.

Rovisco Pais 1, Portugal","During operation, maintenance inside the reactor building at ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) has to be performed by remote handling, due to the presence of activated materials. Maintenance operations involve the transportation and storage of large, heavyweight casks from and to the tokamak building. The transportation is carried out by autonomous vehicles that lift and move beneath these casks. The storage of these casks face several challenges, since (1) the cask storage area is limited in space, and (2) all casks have to be accessible for transportation by the vehicles. In particular, casks in the storage area may block other casks, so that the former has to be moved to a temporary position to give way to the latter. This paper addresses the challenge of managing the logistics of cask storage, where casks may have different typologies. In particular, we propose an approach to (1) determine the best position of the casks inside the storage area, and to (2) obtain the sequence of operations required to retrieve and store an arbitrary cask from/to a given storage place. A combinatorial optimization approach is used to obtain solutions to both these problems. Simulation results illustrate the application of the proposed method to a simple scenario. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",STRAT,ITER,TRANSPORT,2013,Cask and Plug Remote Handling System; ITER; Logistics; Remote handling; Storage location assignment,Experimental reactors; Logistics; Maintenance; Materials handling equipment; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Activated materials; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; ITER; Logistics management; Maintenance operations; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Storage location assignments; Storage (materials),"Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear – Laboratório Associado/IST, (Pest-OE/SADG/LA0010/2011); Laboratório de Robótica e Sistemas em Engenharia e Ciências; Instituto Superior Técnico, IST; Fundació Catalana de Trasplantament, FCT",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884982156

The approach is based on three main assumptions: the DC remote handling activities and the equipment shall be simplified as much as possible; technologies well known and consolidated in the industrial context can be adopted also in the nuclear fusion field; the design of the RHE should be based on a simply supported beam approach instead of cantilever approach. In detail, during the maintenance activities the barycentre of the DC is centred with respect to DC supports. This solution could simplify the design of RHE with a consequent reduction of the design and development costs. Moreover also the DC remote handling tasks shall be simplified in order to better manage the DC maintenance processes. For this reason the DC assembly and disassembly process has been simplified dividing the main sequences in basic movements.

This is probably because the jacket contains the filler ""white carbon (SiO2·nH2O)"" which adsorbs large amount of moisture.

As ITER construction moves closer, there is a need to look at R&D issues that ITER faces with respect to lessons learned in other fields where hazardous environment requires significant developments in remote technologies as well. The most significant experience within the fusion community took place at Joint European Torus (JET) where remote handling techniques have been developed to a stage that allows in-vessel maintenance work to be carried out fully remotely. JET's RH team developed a methodology and a rational approach that drive their success. French nuclear energy industry has gathered a significant knowledge in the remote handling technology that can be used as guidelines for the development of the future remote handling systems required for ITER. French Nuclear Energy Agency (CEA) has been involved in many situations, where design of new remote handling equipment (RHE) has been required to operate under satisfactory conditions. During decommissioning activities of existing nuclear facilities, remote handling is required in some situation over a broad range. When considering remote operation in future nuclear facilities, design of RH equipment deeply impacts facilities design activities.

To fulfill the tasks in ITER application, this paper presents a hybrid redundant manipulator with four DOFs provided by serial kinematic axes and six DOFs by parallel mechanism. Thus, in machining, to achieve greater end-effector trajectory tracking accuracy for surface quality, a robust control of the actuators for the flexible link has to be deduced. In this paper, the intelligent control of a hydraulically driven parallel robot part based on the dynamic model and two control schemes have been investigated: (1) fuzzy-PID self tuning controller composed of the conventional PID control and with fuzzy logic; (2) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-PID (ANFIS-PID) self tuning of the gains of the PID controller, which are implemented independently to control each hydraulic cylinder of the parallel robot based on rod position predictions. The obtained results of the fuzzy-PID and ANFIS-PID self tuning controller can reduce more tracking errors than the conventional PID controller. Subsequently, the serial component of the hybrid robot can be analyzed using the equilibrium of reaction forces at the universal joint connections of the hexa-element. To achieve precise positional control of the end effector for maximum precision machining, the hydraulic cylinder should be controlled to hold the hexa-element. Finally, simulated results that demonstrate the robot behaviors are presented. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2014,ANFIS; Flexible parallel robot; Fuzzy control; Hydraulic actuators; PID control,Controllers; Electric control equipment; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy logic; Hydraulic actuators; Industrial robots; Intelligent control; Maintenance; Mechanical actuators; Mechanisms; Proportional control systems; Robust control; Three term control systems; Tokamak devices; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; ANFIS; End-effector trajectory; Intelligent controllers; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Parallel robots; Position predictions; Self-tuning controllers; Experimental reactors,,Elsevier Ltd,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905909015

In the insertion tests, the module was successfully inserted up to a misalignment of ±10 mm with a clearance of ±(0.16-0.18) mm between key and groove. This was achieved owing to the passive compliance due to the flexibility of the manipulator with the assistance of the chamfer configuration of the key for smooth insertion.

Maintenance and integration design have been also carried out for the diagnostic components to be installed in the upper port plug. From the electromagnetic and structural analyses, it has come up an important problem to suppress the displacement of the upper port plug rather than to reduce the produced stress. Reducing the electro-magnetic (EM) force will help to decrease the severity of potential displacement. Maximum displacement of the port plug decreases with increase in the number of slits in a manner that the displacement would seem to be less than the design tolerance. A proposed low body roller and inner frame may enhance maintenance and integration.

The tritium levels within the vessel have remained sufficiently high, 6.2 g at the end of the DTE1 experiment and currently 1.5 g, such that the AGHS has been required to operate continuously to detritiate gases liberated during D-D operations and to maintain discharges to the environment to ALARP. Maintaining the system to ensure continued operation has been a key factor in guaranteeing the continued availability of the essential sub-systems. The operational history of the JET AGHS has been previously documented in a number of papers [R. Lässer, et al. Proc. of the 19th SOFT Conf. 1 (1996) 227; R. Lässer, et al., Fusion Eng. Des. 46 (1999) 307; P.D. Brennan, et al., 18th Symp. on Fusion Eng., 1999]. Operational downtime is minimised through well-engineered sub-systems that use high integrity components. Outage, contamination and operator dosage are minimised through pre-planned and prepared maintenance operations. The reliability of sub-system critical condition fault detection is demonstrated through routine testing of hard-wired alarms and interlocks. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The VVPSS is a key safety aspect of the vacuum vessel of ITER. It ensures that after a coolant leak, and subsequent pressure event, the vessel is protected from the expanding gasses by controlling and venting them appropriately. After an Ingress of Coolant Event (ICE), or during maintenance, the bleed line valve and rupture disk assemblies will require removal and replacement. During removal the confinement function of vessel must be retained. The remote handling of these components while maintaining the first confinement boundary is challenging due to the access restrictions around the pipe flange and environmental conditions in the area. To understand and develop the remote handling strategy for ITER, prototype tooling a mock-up environment has been created. This allows development and confidence in the proposed maintenance strategy leading to the final solution for use at ITER. In this paper we will discuss the prototype tests, the strategies and challenges which need to be overcome for the ITER application, and design considerations that must be taken to future designs to achieve a feasible solution for ITER. © 2020",STRAT FAC,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2020,ITER; Maintenance; Remote handling; Vacuum vessel pressure suppression system,Coolants; Flanges; Maintenance; Materials handling; Remote control; Rupture disks; Software testing; Access restriction; Design considerations; Environmental conditions; ITER; ITER vacuum vessels; Maintenance strategies; Remote handling; Suppression systems; Planning,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078698220

As far as it is known, it is the first such study for DEMO, and the work was coordinated by EFDA. The approach of the study was that DEMO divertor and its handling shall be very similar to that of ITER, therefore ITER divertor segmentation and maintenance schemes were used as starting point. The maintenance scheme for both ITER and DEMO is the following: the divertor is segmented into cassettes. For maintenance 3 divertor ports are used through which all equipment and cassettes are inserted and removed. A toroidal rail based machine transports the element toroidally in front of the port, from where a radial tractor is used that move it between cask and VV. The main difference between DEMO and ITER is the increase in major radius from 6.2 to 7.5 m, and the cassette segmentation changed from 6.66° to 11.25°. These two factors increase the cassette weight from 12 to 25 tons. Therefore the cantilevered radial transportation of ITER cassettes was not adapted, but instead, the first design of a new, bottom supported radial machine is proposed. For the entire blanket maintenance 70 days were calculated instead of the 179 days in ITER. It was also concluded, that if in-vessel toroidal machine is used for blanket maintenance, there are no real possibilities for parallel blanket/divertor replacement. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The structure may damage and the system will possible be failed when the DSD moving through GRIP which is a mutant site. Based on special constitution, restriction conditions and working process of DSD, kinematics simulation and analysis were done by software ADAMS. The DSD moving equations were built based on the degree of freedom (DOF) of DSD mechanism system, and then the force of DSD moving were calculated in theoretical analyzing. By the above simulation and theoretical calculation the stress distribution of guide rail and hydraulic pole were obtained, at the same time optimization design of GRIP was confirmed according to the force analysis results.

The MCS is an underhung crane that moves along the railways suspended from the NB cell ceiling. It is part of the Neutral Beam Remote Handling System (NBRHS) providing lifting and transportation capabilities for components and equipment up to 40tonnes. The long travel unit of the MCS is a first-of-a-kind design which is identified as the technical risky area for which is worth to perform mock-up testing. This paper describes the mock-up design of the railway where the MCS moves, and the long travel unit of the MCS. The mock-up railway replicates the critical parts of the railway such as that having the minimum bending radius, the S-bend, and the switching rails with discontinuity and misalignments. The mock-up MCS replicates most of the key features of the final MCS together with additional sensors for analysis. The mock-ups are manufactured to verify the manufacturing process of the final MCS. Phased testing campaigns are carried out to understand the behavior of the mock-up MCS on the different railway sections under various load cases such as no load, offset load, dynamic and static test loads, and considering different communication and control system arrangements including degraded modes. The test results demonstrate that the behavior of the mock-MCS is as expected in the design. However, a few areas are identified that need to be improved, which are the vibration and noise issues during traveling on the curved rails, stopping of traveling while carrying an offset load, which results in damage on the barcode strip and the busbar clamps installed on the railways. Post-test inspection identified permanent deformation on the edge of the railway, a leak on the lubrication on the rotating wheels, and some rusting, which need to be improved in the final MCS design. From a global point of view, no critical technical issues were observed during the testing and the tested components, especially, the high load carrying components are in good condition without any mechanical damages. Therefore, the MCS design can be further developed on this basis during the final design phase, addressing the various feedbacks gathered through the testing campaigns. © 2022 ITER",HARD,ITER,NBI,2023,ITER; Monorail crane; Neutral beam; Remote handling,Materials handling; Mockups; Particle beams; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Crane systems; ITER; Long-travel; Mock up; Monorail crane; Neutral beams; Offset loads; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Workers'; Monorails,"Instituto Tecnológico y de Energías Renovables, ITER",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145649001

In order to fulfill the requirements on the complicated multi machining functions and the high performance motion control, the software design of robot is divided into two main parts accordingly, which consists of the user-oriented HMI part and robot control-oriented real-time control system. The two parts of software are deployed in the different hardware for the consideration of run-time performance, which forms a client-server-control architecture. Therefore a high-level task-oriented protocol is designed for the data inter-communication between the HMI part and the control system part, in which all the transmitting data related to a machining task is divided into three categories: trajectory-oriented data, task control-oriented data and status monitoring-oriented data. The protocol consists of three sub-protocols accordingly - a trajectory protocol, task control protocol and status protocol - which are deployed over the Ethernet and run as independent processes in both the client and server computers. The protocols are able to manage the vast amounts of data streaming due to the multi machining functions in a more efficient way. Since the protocol is functioning in the software as a role of middleware, and providing the data interface standards for the developing groups of two parts of software, it also permits greater focus of both software parts developers on their own requirements-oriented design. By applying these protocols, the software for a multi-task robot machine that is used for ITER vacuum vessel assembly and maintenance has been developed and it is demonstrated that machining tasks of the robot machine, such as milling, drilling, welding etc., can be implemented in both an individual and composite way. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, it provides training and certification to the RH maintenance operators, by making available to operators the knowledge, instructions and experiencing of the Virtual Simulator platform, the control room devices, the robots and tooling to be used for RH tasks. In this work, the preliminary architecture of the DTT REMHAT facility is described, with a focus on the added value of the adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies enabling real-time alignment of virtual robots’ configuration with the real ones (Digital Twin). A first approach to the facility design is proposed, starting from the technical requirements: Environmental, Design, Physical, Functional, Operational, Human Factors and Product assurance and safety. The proposed logical architecture consists of four Sub-Systems (S/S): building and auxiliaries, mock-ups, robots and Control Room. In the present work, a particular attention is paid on the last one. The idea is to create a digital twin of the RH equipment mock-ups to be coupled with software of real-time structural simulation, in order to have at disposition and show in VR environment real-time additional information about the real environment, like robots’ deflections and/or vibrations, clearances and possible collisions detection. These data could be crucial for the operator's decision-making process about a sudden intervention on the RH system, further to their employment for future studies and optimization. Therefore, for each subsystem of the facility, the components identification and a description of the software and hardware aspects are provided. In conclusion, an overview of the critical issues of such complex system is presented, in order to prepare the ground for future research works. © 2023 The Authors",FAC,DTT,(general/none),2023,Digital twin; DTT; Remote handling system; Test and training facility; Virtual reality,Acceptance tests; Computer software; Decision making; E-learning; Materials handling; Mockups; Personnel training; Product design; Remote control; Robots; DTT; Handling equipments; Maintenance procedures; Optimisations; Qualification testing; Real- time; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Test and training facility; Training facility; Virtual reality,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85169907154

The unparalleled scale of these components, coupled with extremely tight positional tolerances, demands careful consideration of structural flexibility during manoeuvres. This underscores the need for model-based control systems capable of mitigating oscillations and static deflections induced by gravity and disturbances. In this paper, we present recent experiments towards this objective, focussed on mitigating the effects of gravity. We applied model-based, optimal feedforward control to the motion of a planar slender payload, chosen to represent the flexible part of a candidate breeding blanket segment. We combined a predictive path planning algorithm with input shaping techniques to manoeuvre the payload effectively accounting for the influence of gravity, while also reducing post-manoeuvre oscillations. Our results highlight the advantages of model-based control and the limitations associated with the use of feedforward control. © 2024",SOFT,DEMO,BLANKET,2024,Breeding blankets; Model-based control; Path planning; Remote handling; Trajectory optimisation,Breeding blankets; Computer control systems; Feedforward control; Flexible structures; Materials handling; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Flexible parts; Model based controls; Model-based control systems; Model-based OPC; Optimal feedforward control; Path-planning algorithm; Remote handling; Static deflections; Structural flexibilities; Trajectory optimization; Motion planning,"European Commission, EC, (101052200 — EUROfusion); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/W006839/1)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188902297

In order to control the machine configuration and ensure proper design integration, the ITER project has implemented the so-called ""configuration management models"" (CMMs), aimed at controlling and managing the machine systems' interfaces. Specific issues are raised for modelling the ITER remote maintenance system (IRMS). That system shall provide the mean to support the remote maintenance operations for in-vessel components, remote transfer of activated components between the vacuum vessel (VV) and the hot cell facility and remote repairing, refurbishing and/or processing operations in the hot cell facility. The IRMS are dynamic, constantly changing morphologies, working envelopes and locations within the plant. This raises the issue of how to integrate the dynamic nature of this equipment into the CMM required for design integration. This paper describes the design methodology that is being developed to address the specific nature of the IRMS in the building of the CMM and gives examples to demonstrate the benefits to be gained by adopting this approach. © 2011 ITER Organization.

The proposed manipulator is capable of flexibly maneuvering around the big manipulator, extracting the stop elements, and placing them into a basket. It can also fold itself to create more space for the operation of the big manipulator. The kinematic model of the redundant manipulator was established based on the application of the Modified Denavit-Hartenberg (MDH) method, and an unconstrained optimization equation was formulated using quaternions. To solve this equation, an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm was developed by enhancing the local search capability of the employed bees and improving the search efficiency of the observation bees. The feasibility of the structural design and the IABC algorithm was verified by carrying out trajectory planning simulations of the manipulator. The design of the 7 DOFs manipulator and the corresponding offline inverse kinematics algorithm provide valuable references for the maintenance work in the upper port remote maintenance of the DEMO. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,DEMO,IN-VESSEL,2024,DEMO; IABC; Quaternion method; Redundant DOFs; Remote maintenance; Trajectory planning,Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Industrial manipulators; Inverse kinematics; Maintenance; Motion planning; Optimization; Redundancy; Robot programming; Structural design; Artificial bees; Bee colony algorithms; DEMO; Design Analysis; Improved artificial bee colony; Quaternion methods; Redundant degree of freedom; Remote maintenance; Structure design; Trajectory Planning; Redundant manipulators,"Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology Program of China, (2018-000052-73-01-001228); Postgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province, (KYCX23_0359); State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control for Aerospace Structures, (1005-IZD23002-25); Euratom Research and Training Programme, EURATOM, (101052200 — EUROfusion); European Commission, EC",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181814993

This paper focuses on maintenance aspects of the machine. As the plasma facing components inside the fusion reactors become highly activated caused by the neutrons generated by fusion reactions, maintenance of the fusion reactors needs to be done by remote means. In order to increase machine availability, it is required to have efficient maintenance scenario in terms of time and effort, which can be achieved through effective in-vessel remote handling (RH) operations, simplified maintenance of the RH system itself, well-coordinated logistics, and trained personnel, etc. All these aspects need to be investigated during the design phases, which requires a well-defined concept of operation of the RH systems. This paper describes the concept of operation of the Agile Robot Transporter (ART), an ITER in-vessel RH system, that is under development to carry out neutron and optical diagnostic calibrations, and removal/replacement of the blanket first wall samples. Based on the functional analysis of the required in-vessel tasks, system requirements are defined. Among them, key requirements to improve RH operation efficiency are identified and the ART is designed accordingly. Efficient deployment and removal operations of the ART are crucial so that it requires less vacuum vessel (VV) port opening and less cask transportation, which reduces needs for hands-on operations resulting in less human radiation exposure. Various and flexible tool exchange and storage concepts are proposed that allow parallel operations between the in-vessel and ex-vessel RH systems. Modular and re-configurable design is proposed for easy RH system maintenance, and effective rescue operations to rescue the RH system when it fails. © 2024",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2024,Agile Robot Transporter; Fusion reactor; ITER; Remote handling; Robotics; Tokamak,Agile manufacturing systems; Fusion reactions; Magnetoplasma; Materials handling; Remote control; Robots; Tokamak devices; Agile robot transporter; Agile robots; Concepts of operations; ITER; Machine availability; Maintenance scenario; Plasma-facing components; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Tokamak; Maintenance,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188704185

This makes the ITER WCS a very complicated system with many components requiring periodical inspection and maintenance. The main radiological concern for the staff involved in such activities is due to the activated corrosion products (ACPs) generated by corrosion of the inner wall of the piping under the neutron flux. In the present study the collective dose due to the ACP for one loop of the ITER WCS is assessed. Two different maintenance and inspection (M/I) approaches (or working strategies) for the ITER WCS components are to be considered. The first one is usually applied in American and European designs of pressurized water reactors (PWRs) that have cooling loops similar to those envisaged in ITER. The other one is the strategy proposed by the ITER WCS designers that takes into account the actual plant layout and technology. Both strategies have been implemented in the occupational radiation exposure (ORE) assessment process and two results have been obtained. The similarity is then performed pointing out the differences between the two approaches, trying to indicate what is the best one from the ORE point of view.",ASSESS,ITER,CRYO,2000,,Experimental reactors; Loss of coolant accidents; Occupational risks; Pressurized water reactors; Radiation effects; Activated corrosion products (ACP); International thermonuclear experimental reactor water cooling system; Fusion reactors,,Elsevier Sequoia SA,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034318549

The programme aims to train engineers for activities supporting the ITER project and the long-term fusion programme. One of the projects of this programme focuses on the verification and validation (V&V) of ITER RH system requirements using digital mock-ups (DMU). The purpose of this project is to study and develop efficient approach of using DMUs in the V&V process of ITER RH system design utilizing a System Engineering (SE) framework. Complex engineering systems such as ITER facilities lead to substantial rise of cost while manufacturing the full-scale prototype. In the V&V process for ITER RH equipment, physical tests are a requirement to ensure the compliance of the system according to the required operation. Therefore it is essential to virtually verify the developed system before starting the prototype manufacturing phase. This paper gives an overview of the current trends in using digital mock-up within product design processes. It suggests a simulation-based process design centralized around a simulation lifecycle management system. The purpose of this paper is to describe possible improvements in the formalization of the ITER RH design process and V&V processes, in order to increase their cost efficiency and reliability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,ITER,(general/none),2014,Digital mock-up; ITER; Remote handling; Simulation-based design; Validation; Verification,Cost engineering; Manufacture; Mockups; Product design; Remote control; Verification; Digital Mock-up; ITER; Remote handling; Simulation-based designs; Validation; Materials handling,Technical Research Centre of Finland; Tekes; Teknologian Tutkimuskeskus VTT,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905976991

The primary objective is to assess the radiation impact and devise strategies to attenuate its effects on the UPRHE components. Radiation levels in various operational zones are deduced from the ITER radiation map. This analysis includes a meticulous definition of operation sequences and corresponding durations for each maintenance task executed by the UPRHE. It is imperative to evaluate each subsystem of the UPRHE for its resilience against the maximum conceivable dose rate and the cumulative TID throughout its operational lifespan. The estimation of TID for the UPRHE encompasses both hourly rates and cumulative doses, calculated based on the identified dose levels and task durations. Additionally, this study computes the TID for all UPRHE subsystems over both a single long-term maintenance (LTM) cycle and the projected 20-year lifespan. Subsequently, the study justifies the derived TID values with the established nuclear radiation alert thresholds for ITER electronics. This comparison reveals that most UPRHE components remain within the safety margin. For components surpassing these thresholds, the paper proposes mitigation strategies to refine the system design in subsequent development phases. © 2024",ASSESS,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2024,ITER; Total ionizing dose; Upper port remote handling equipment,Ionizing radiation; Materials handling; Radiation effects; Dose estimations; Handling equipments; ITER; Lifespans; Primary objective; Radiation impacts; Radiation levels; Remote handling; Total Ionizing Dose; Upper port remote handling equipment; Remote control,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187803311

However, the coupling structure and high redundancy of the EAMA, due to the requirement of coverage ratio and the limitation of the EAST environment, produces a limited accuracy in positioning control. Therefore, the optimal design of the geometric parameters plays a vital role in the EAMA's performance. In this paper, the main characteristics of the EAMA system are investigated to formulate the optimization into a multi-objective problem. Furthermore, an approach based on the Monte Carlo method, integrated with a dedicated collision detection algorithm in the EAST environment, is elaborated on, which is utilized to calculate the collision-free workspace of the EAMA. With the knowledge of the workspace, the coverage ratio is obtained by a progressive meshing technique. Finally, several groups of geometric parameters are sampled to calculate the corresponding value of the objective functions, and the optimized combination of the geometric parameters is obtained by comparing the results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",HARD,EAST,IN-VESSEL,2019,Collision detection; Coverage ratio; EAMA; Geometric parameters; Monte carlo method; Workspace,Collision avoidance; Electric discharges; Geometry; Magnetoplasma; Maintenance; Collision detection; Coverage ratio; EAMA; Geometric parameters; Workspace; Monte Carlo methods,"National “973” Program of China, (2014GB101000)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060104174

The principal requirements were the quality of cut necessary for rewelding, effective swarf removal, and compactness for remote handling. The designs of tools had to be compatible with the severe access restrictions imposed by the JET machine. The processes used by the tools are sawing from the inside and outside of pipes, and orbital lathe for larger pipes. Special features were created on the pipes to facilitate tool location. The blade and toolbit designs have evolved to optimize cutting forces and tool durability. Satisfactory reliability has been achieved by performing 200 h of cutting during the two year period of development. Subsequently, over 100 'hands-on' cutting operations have been made on the JET machine since 1988 and a further 150 cuts are planned for 1992. Using a programmable controller the feed rate can be changed throughout the cutting operation. © 1991 IEEE.",HARD,JET,(general/none),1991,,Materials handling; Remote control; Access restriction; Cutting forces; Cutting operations; Feed-rates; JET machines; Joint European Torus; Remote handling; Tool durabilities; Cutting tools,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067671682

The platform consists of radiation tolerant materials and joints, a long cantilever arm with redundant degrees of freedom, a rapid control prototype, a vacuum vessel model, a bolts driving tool, cutting tools, and a virtual reality software. The design of this platform is partly presented: 10 degrees of freedom are demonstrated; the length of articulated arm reaches 3.15 m; the load capacity of terminal is 10 kg; the radiation tolerance of a test arm with electro-hydraulic joints reaches 4MGy in gamma ray. The motion planning is tested in a vacuum vessel model. The primary process is also studied by the end effectors for functional researches. Screwing and unscrewing bolts are successfully realized without connecting to cantilever arm, but pipe cutting from outside space still faces some force issues, and the laser cutting tool for inner pipe working space brings about waste contamination problems, which requires improvement.

Furthermore, authors have also found that maraging steel treated by a black chrome plating can withstand a cumulative dose of 1 MGy without corroding, enabling the use of maraging steel wrenches, which are essential for FW central bolt torquing.

Therefore, special attention should be paid to the design and analysis of its feedback controllers. Firstly, the design of the multivariable tracking controller possesses many challenges. The hydraulic manipulator dynamics are highly nonlinear; moreover, the loaded mass spans a wide range. Secondly, a number of test runs (even a large number) do not necessarily reveal the controller sensitivity to all the system uncertainties. Thus, some theoretical tools are needed to assess the robustness of the controller. H-based approach is a reasonable choice since it provides a set of metrics to evaluate the controller robustness which can be validated in tests. In this paper, the dynamic model of CMM is first derived, characterizing the nominal system model and the model uncertainties. Then, a multivariable H loop-shaping controller is synthesized which ensures both the robust stability and robust performance.

The D-H (Denavit-Hartenberg) parameter was established to analyze the kinematics of manipulator, and the reachable workspace of manipulator was obtained by Monte-Carlo method. The high-order polynomial interpolation method was applied to plan a smooth and continuous interpolation curve for the motion trajectory simulation of the CFETR (China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor) vacuum vessel remote handling, which obtains the simulation curve of the manipulator end. The angular velocity and torque of each joint change smoothly, and the maximum value does not exceed the design value of the robot, which proved the correctness of the algorithm and the feasibility of the trajectory planning to a certain extent. The simulation results showed that the manipulator can adapt to the complex environment inside the vacuum vessel, and can effectively plan the motion trajectory that meets the requirements of the established space task.

The in-vessel components are full graphite tiles as first wall had been operated successfully. In the experiment campaign of 2010, the H mode operation and 1 MA operation have been gotten on EAST. However, in some case, some of the graphite tiles of divertor region are damaged with the plasma parameter enhanced. As most of the damaged graphite tiles are in the divertor region, they are probably damaged by the electro-magnetic force of the halo current when the VDEs occur. The force of the halo current is re-estimated. The structure analysis has been done by the ANSYS software. From the analysis result. It can be obtained that the stress is larger than the allowable stress when the halo current on the graphite tile is larger than 2.7 kA. The tensile testing of the graphite also has been done. As the result, the graphite tiles are damaged when the forces are up to 2400 N. To deal with the problem, two proposes are accepted. In the one hand, the new type graphite material is used, whose tensile strength is up to 45 MPa. In the other hand, the structure of the graphite tiles is optimized. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",OVER,EAST,DIVERTOR,2012,Divertor; EAST; Graphite tile; R&D,Fusion reactor divertors; Tensile testing; Allowable stress; ANSYS software; Divertor region; EAST; Electromagnetic forces; First wall; Graphite materials; Graphite tiles; H-mode operations; Halo currents; In-vessel components; Magnetic coil; Plasma parameter; Steady-state operation; Structure analysis; Graphite,,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865795827

The NB cell is a radiation-controlled area where human worker access is strictly limited or prohibited depending on the NB cell configurations. Establishing the maintenance processes in the early design phase of a RH system is crucial in order to guarantee that the overall system configuration satisfies the maintenance requirements in given conditions and constraints. This paper describes the remote maintenance scenario of the beam line components (BLC) of the NB system by using the neutral beam remote handling system (NBRHS). This operation is a corrective maintenance operation that could happen multiple times during lifetime of ITER. If one of the BLCs fails, the failed NBI is isolated by closing the absolute valve to continue the tokamak operation. After that when the long-term maintenance campaign starts, the failed BLC needs to be replaced. The maintenance sequences involve human worker hands-on operations in the hot cell complex (HCC) and in the NB cell to prepare the RH operations, deployment operations of the NBRHS and the RH tools, removal/opening/transportation/storage operations to access to the failed component, and to remove and replace the failed component. Many RH tools are required during these processes such as unbolting/bolting, connector disconnection/connection, pipe cutting/welding/inspection, heavy and large component handling etc. Moreover, the operations need to be done without or minimizing spreading of contamination from the NBI vessels/components to the NB cell as the NB cell shall remain human accessible area during the long-term maintenance periods. The maintenance sequence study shows that the developed RH sequence is applicable in the current NB cell environment and is compatible with the defined interfaces in the plant systems. The developed scenario needs to be elaborated further detail in the next design phases together with the detail design of the RH equipment and the RH tools. © 2022",STRAT,ITER,NBI,2022,Beam line components; Fusion reactor; ITER; Maintainability; Neutral beam system; Remote handling; Robotics; Tokamak,Corrective maintenance; Cytology; Fusion reactions; Materials handling; Particle beams; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Beam line component; Beam system; Beam-lines; ITER; Neutral beam injectors; Neutral beam system; Neutral beams; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Tokamak; Cells,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140796355

The narrow space around some of the pipes hinders the suitability of conventional orbital processes. For such pipes, both the cutting system and the welding one have to be compact enough to move along their interior, lock against the pipe inner wall and keep the position during the operation. The inner diameter and thickness of the pipes together with the other severe requirements related to the remote maintenance drive the choice of the processing technologies and the design of the tooling configuration. In this work, activities carried out by a joint team from EU-DEMO and CFETR on the in-bore cutting and welding operations are presented and discussed. For the in-bore cutting system a solution for the simultaneous parting and bevelling has been developed opting for a mechanical cutting with a pair of symmetrically distributed knives. A preliminary dimensioning of the motors has been made assuming the radial feed and the cutting speed of the knives. For the in-bore welding system, the TIG welding with filler wire has been considered as the most reliable and suitable technology within prescribed requirements and constraints. A multi-pass welding operation has been assumed. A conceptual design of both tools has been developed. The space constraint remains the most critical issue.

To increase the tritium breeding ratio (TBR), the design scheme adopts a hybrid divertor&#x2013;blanket integration concept where a breeding blanket is placed underneath targets instead of a cassette. The novel front-face remote handling (RH) targets are designed aiming to explore whether the targets could be maintained from the plasma side. Three unique independent RH design schemes are developed separately for the inner, dome, and outer targets. Hypervaportron flat-tile units are optimized in the high heat flux (HHF) area with an engineering requirement of 20 MW/m<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{2}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> steady-state heat load. All the targets have good RH compatibility with RH tools in the maintenance procedure. Preliminary analysis with respect to pumping performance, hydraulics, heat removal ability, and structure meets the requirements. The research and development is based on advanced fusion reactor materials and realizable materials&#x2019; connection technology. The advanced materials of potassium-doped tungsten (KW), oxide dispersion-strengthened copper (ODS-Cu) alloy, and reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steel are used as armor, heat sink, and structural materials, respectively. One of the realizable material connection routes is that RAFM steel is explosively welded with ODS-Cu and then the KW/Cu flat tiles are brazed with ODS-Cu. The small-sized mock-up successfully endured 1000 cycles with 20 MW/m<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{2}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> steady-state heat load. The maximum temperature of the KW surface was 882 <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$^{\circ}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>C, much lower than the supposed recrystallization temperature.

Reactor structures and maintenance machines are arranged so that the component inside a shielding structure can he replaced through the hatches located on the upper side of the torus shielding structure. The plasma vacuum boundary is constituted by the inside wall of the shielding structure. The magnet vacuum chamber contains two toroidal magnets in a single room, so that strong support structures can be placed between these toroidal magnets. A merit of this reactor is that the inboard reactor structures are accessible with keeping the magnet cryogenic condition and without disassembling any major reactor components. The practicability of this method will depend on the time required to move the blanket segments in the toroidal direction and to weld pipes by remote handling. A number of ideas for reducing this time are presented. © 1981 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",STRAT SYS,(none),(general/none),1981,Conceptual design; Maintenance machine; Maintenance methods; Reactor maintenance; Reactor structure; Repair; Tokamak fusion reactor,,"Toshiba Corp; Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, JAERI",,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0019576333

This work aims at providing a single formalism and tools to define in a generic way the ITER maintenance tasks and scenarios for in-vessel and hot cell operations. A three-layered approach is proposed to model these tasks and scenarios. Physical actions are defined for the scene elements. From these physical actions, behaviours are defined to represent high-level functionalities. Finally, interaction modes define the way that behaviours are achieved in terms of human-machine interactions. Case study concerning the blanket maintenance procedure is discussed concerning the contributions of the descriptive model and the context-based assistances to the activities of supervisory control. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",SOFT,ITER,(general/none),2013,Human-machine interactions; Remote handling; Supervisory control system,Biological organs; Man machine systems; Materials handling; Process control; Remote control; Tools; Descriptive Model; Human machine interaction; Interaction modes; Maintenance procedures; Maintenance tasks; Remote handling; Supervisory control; Supervisory control systems; Maintenance,"Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives, CEA",,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884974991

The maintenance devices and tools inside a cask receive power and signals during operation from the cask automatic connectors which are located at both sides of the Hot Cell Docking ports and the Tokamak machine Docking ports, respectively. For perfect transmission of power and signals, the automatic connector should have self-alignment capability and reasonable cable routing. Structural flexibility should be designed for the connector to compensate for the engagement misalignment induced by the structure and the control of the cask transporter. Moreover, the automatic connector should be connecting electric wires for motors, sensors, fiber optics, etc. The automatic connector must have high reliability to ensure that there will be no damage during the life cycle of the fusion reactor. A conceptual design of the connector has been developed.

For this to be effective, safe and efficient the plant will have to be developed in accordance with remote handling (RH) compatibility requirements. A system for ensuring RH compatibility on plant designed for Tokamaks was successfully developed and applied, inter alia, by the authors when working at the JET project. The experience gained in assuring RH compatibility of plant at JET is now being applied to RH relevant ITER plant. The methodologies required to ensure RH compatibility of plant include the standardization of common plant items, standardization of RH features, availability of common guidance on RH best practice and a protocol for design and interface review and approval. The protocol in use at ITER is covered by the ITER Remote Maintenance Management System (IRMMS) defines the processes and utilization of management controls including Plant Definition Forms (PDF), Task Definition Forms (TDFs) and RH Compatibility Assessment Forms (RHCA) and the ITER RH Code of Practice. This paper will describe specific examples where the authors have applied the methodology proven at JET to ensure remote handling compatibility on ITER plant. Examples studied are:ELM coils (to be installed in-vessel behind the Blanket Modules) - handling both in-vessel, in Casks and at the Hot Cell as well as fully remote installation and connection (mechanical and electrical) in-vessel.Neutral beam systems (in-vessel and in the NB Cell) - beam sources, cesium oven, beam line components (accessed in the NB Cell) and Duct Liner (remotely replaced from in-vessel).Divertor (in-vessel) - cooling pipe work and remotely operated electrical connector. The RH compatibility process can significantly affect plant design. This paper should therefore be of interest to all parties who develop ITER plant designs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Design simplicity, maintainability, and reasonable maintenance downtimes are crucial for viable and competitive fusion economics. The ARIES-IV design team developed a maintenance scheme that allows rapid and simultaneous replacement of all of the components in a large, self-contained fusion-power-core (FPC) section. The FPC is divided into 16 self-contained `pie-shaped' sections that can be removed horizontally through large vacuum-vessel access ports located between the outer legs of the toroidal-field (TF) coils. Prior to commitment to service, the entire FPC section assembly is pretested extensively to maximize operating reliability. To facilitate this radial section-removal scheme, the TF coils and the poloidal-field (PF) coils of the ARIES-IV tokamak had to be enlarged. The advantages of the ARIES-IV section-replacement scheme over more traditional approaches, where individual FPC components are removed sequentially from the vacuum vessel, outweigh the cost increases associated with larger TF- and PF-coil systems.",OVER,ARIES,(general/none),1993,,Components; Cryostats; Economics; Electric coils; Maintenance; Nuclear power plants; Parameter estimation; Plasma stability; Pressure vessels; Reactor cores; Shells (structures); ARIES-IV fusion power plant; Fusion power core; Toroidal field and poloidal field coils; Tokamak devices,,Publ by IEEE,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0027732422

The main structural component of the BRHS, a telescopic arm, will be covered with a sleeve that must prevent not only the radioactive dust from infiltrating into the system but also lubricant from leaking out into the vacuum vessel. Verifying the radiation resistance of this sleeve is crucial and will ultimately affect the operation scenarios and timing of preventive maintenance for the BRHS. Thermoplastic polyurethane was selected as a candidate material for the sleeve. This paper presents the results of gamma-ray irradiation tests up to either 1MGy or 2MGy for polyurethane sheets and the results of subsequent bending, tensile, and hardness tests. Based on the results of these tests, mock-ups of the sleeve were manufactured and were also irradiated up to either 1MGy or 2MGy, after which the mock-ups underwent expansion and contraction tests to simulate actual operations in ITER. We have concluded from conservative estimates that, although these polyurethane sleeve mock-ups have over 1MGy of radiation resistance, the sleeves of the BRHS should be replaced at 1MGy. © (2024), (The Japan Society of Plasma Science and Nuclear Fusion Research).

A layer of middleware will manage and control a complex set of interconnections between teams of operators, hardware devices in various operating theatres, and databases managing tool and task logistics. The middleware is driven by constraints on amounts and timing of data like real-time control loops, camera images, and database access. The Remote Handling Study Centre (RHSC), located at FOM institute DIFFER, has a 4-operator work cell in an ITER relevant RH Control Room setup which connects to a virtual hot cell back-end. The centre is developing and testing flexible integration of the Control Room components, resulting in proof-of-concept tests of this middleware layer. SW components studied include generic human-machine interface software, a prototype of a RH operations management system, and a distributed virtual reality system supporting multi-screen, multi-actor, and multiple independent views. Real-time rigid body dynamics and contact interaction simulation software supports simulation of structural deformation, ""augmented reality"" operations and operator training. The paper presents generic requirements and conceptual design of middleware components and Operations Management System in the context of a RH Control Room work cell.

A significant quantity of tritium would be produced in TBM, and partly released into the port cell from the pipework of TBS or other high-temperature components due to its strong mobility and high permeation. The port cell should be accessible during equipment maintenance and human intervention. This work built a multi-dimensional geometric model to characterize HTO transport in the port cell, absorption/desorption, and diffusion in walls and discussed the effect of paint thickness, ventilation rate, source term, and epoxy properties on detritiation efficiency. The results suggest that a 0.1-0.16 mm paint with the lowest HTO solubility is optimal from the compromise between quick cleanup and tritiated waste decommission. A higher ventilation rate could accelerate detritiation while minimizing the radioactive source by a tritium-resisting layer is the most direct method. The optimized design options for reducing the time required to reach 1 DAC in 12 h still need further discussion because of the delayed HTO source from epoxy paint and dead zone of the flow field. © 2024 The Author(s).

Four straight beams adhered with piezoelectric ceramics form a rectangular frame of the robot. Two-phase bending vibrations with a spatial phase difference of 90° are excited in the two shorter beams respectively, leading tomicroscopic elliptical motions at the driving feet. Therefore, the robot can move in the straight rail utilizing friction. Finite element analysis was carried out to verify the operation principle and to optimize the dimensions of the robot. A prototype of the robot with a mass of 83.8 g was fabricated, assembled and tested. With a driving voltage of 300 Vpp, the maximum velocities in two directions are 92.4 mm/s and 196.5 mm/s respectively. With an excitation voltage of 400 Vpp, the maximum load capacity of the prototype is 200 g. © 2019 IEEE.",HARD,(none),IN-VESSEL,2019,Friction; Piezoelectric robot; Rail; Tokamak maintenance,Acoustic waves; Crystallography; Friction; Maintenance; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectric devices; Piezoelectricity; Railroads; Rails; Tokamak devices; Bending vibrations; Elliptical motion; Excitation voltage; Maintenance operations; Maximum load capacity; Maximum velocity; Piezoelectric robots; Rectangular frame; Robots,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51575265, 51775263, 51905262); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province, (BK20190398); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions, PAPD",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082166809

In-Vessel remote-handling operations will mobilise the dust, which will be deposited on the remote-handling tools used, for which hands-on maintenance is expected. To ensure safe maintenance of the remote-handling equipment, a dedicated decontamination process in the Hot Cell is required. Evaluating the radiation fields produced by the contaminated equipment is central to minimising radiation exposure to personnel. In this study, we present a nuclear analysis of the Divertor Remote Handling System during its transfer and decontamination process. Past computational limitations regarding superficial sources definition and high uncertainties on the dust model have been overcome by implementing a novel methodology and following an alternative approach. Two surface-dependent dust distributions over the complex geometry surfaces were considered to evaluate the dose rates according to the different contamination levels during the process phases. A scoping analysis was performed to determine the amount of dust that would comply with project requirements in each phase of the process. Improvement margins were identified in the quantification of the amount of dust and Hot Cell layout. © 2024 The Author(s)",STRAT,ITER,DIVERTOR,2024,Activated dust; Dose rate; Hot Cell; ITER; Remote-handling,Cells; Cytology; Ionizing radiation; Magnetoplasma; Materials handling; Radiation shielding; Remote control; Activated dust; Dose rate; Dust contamination; Hot Cell; ITER; Model complexes; Plasma-facing components; Radiation source; Remote handling; Remote handling system; Dust,"I+D en Tecnologías, (2023-ETSII-UNED-03, S2018/EMT-4437); Comunidad de Madrid; European Commission, EC, (101052200 —EUROfusion, IO/20/CT/6000000345); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (ENE2015-70733R)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182514220

The current MPD design iteration consists of a boom deployment system that is 30 m long and can support a payload of 1000 kg, while still being able to access the DEMO vacuum vessel through a 2.78 m high by 1.08 m wide port. The purpose of this work is to benefit from previous experience by comparing the mechanical attributes and performance of systems as well as their advantages and disadvantages and any issues encountered to bring design input to MPD design development. The following systems were investigated: Joint European Torus (JET) in-vessel remote handling booms, telescopic articulated remote mast (TARM), Next European Torus (NET) experimental device for in-torus handling (EDITH), Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) Maintenance Manipulator, and Snake-like Robot Arms in Nuclear Environments. Systems that are currently in development for ITER and Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) were also investigated according to their latest available design iterations. This article concludes that these systems, comprising of articulating links to form long-reach slender structures, give rise to challenges with their payload, stiffness, and control. The straight boom style system would be the most suitable design for the current tasks that a DEMO MPD is expected to perform. However, there is no particularly strong candidate without first fully defining the requirements and constraints that a DEMO MPD must adhere to.  © 1973-2012 IEEE.",HARD,DEMO,IN-VESSEL,2022,Fusion power generation; fusion reactor maintenance; high payload robotics; nuclear fusion; nuclear robotics; remote handling; remote maintenance; tokamaks,Fighter aircraft; Fusion reactions; Machine design; Manipulators; Materials handling; Remote control; Robotics; Tokamak devices; Europe; Fusion power; Fusion power generation; Fusion reactor maintenance; High payload robotic; Nuclear fusion; Nuclear robotic; Payload; Power- generations; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Tokamaks.; Maintenance,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC, (EP/T012250/1); European Commission, EC, (101052200-EUROfusion)",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128692177

These blankets are expected to be split into five segments in every torus section [1], each weighing up to 60 tons, and will require periodic replacement through the Upper Port for maintenance. During replacement, the blankets need to be guided in the vacuum vessel through highly restricted kinematic paths to avoid collisions. A Two Port Remote Handling approach is therefore being investigated. In this approach, the Lower Manipulator System (LMS) is expected to operate through the Lower Port to guide the blankets and react to the severe loads arising from the offset between the blankets’ Centre of Gravity (CoG) and the lifting point. Several mechanisms for the LMS have been developed to comprehensively explore blanket handling capabilities using this approach. This paper presents the different LMS concepts and discusses the respective salient features. © 2024",HARD,(none),BLANKET,2024,Breeding blankets; Parallel mechanism; Remote maintenance,Breeding blankets; Heat transfer; Manipulators; Center of gravity; Energy productions; Handling capability; Manipulator systems; Parallel mechanisms; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; System concepts; Vacuum vessel; Vessel walls; Maintenance,"European Commission, EC, (101052200 — EUROfusion)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189856009

The dose rate during the reactor operation can be made low enough for personnel access into the reactor room if a 2 m thick water layer is installed above the magnet cryostat. The dose rate 24 h after shutdown is such that the human access is allowed above the magnet cryostat. Sufficient water layer thickness is provided in the inboard space for the operation of automatic welder/cutter while retaining the magnet shielding capability. Some forced cooling is required for the decay heat removal in the first wall. The penetration shield thickness around the neutral beam injector port is estimated to be barely sufficient in terms of the magnet radiation damage. © 1984.,ASSESS,(none),(general/none),1984,,"TOKAMAK DEVICES - Maintenance; RADIATION SHIELDING; NUCLEAR REACTORS, THERMONUCLEAR",Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0021457319

A crane system is presented consisting of a monorail, a carriage, and a lifting mechanism. The monorail must give access to the BLC's in the beam line vessel, the front components connecting the NB vessel with the Tokamak, and a storage area at the north end of the NB cell. Rail switching points are required at the intersections between radial and toroidal branches. A translational switching mechanism is proposed. The crane carriage consists of two independent sub-carriages, each composed of four wheels. A set of four secondary wheels attached to the main carriage prevents the crane tilting due to the CoG misalignment of some loads. The elevation system proposed consists of an electromechanical crane of four independent drums and 50 tonnes payload.

Fermi 45, Italy; Natalizio A., ENSAC Associates Ltd., Toronto, Ont. M9C 1N4, 87 Markland Dr, Canada","This study has been a first attempt at identifying potential worker overexposure situations during machine maintenance operations. The results indicate potential areas, or situations, where worker overexposure may be possible [A. Natalizio, T. Pinna, Safety analysis of failures and consequences during maintenance, ENEA Report, FUS-TN-SA-SE-R-170, June 2007, Frascati, Italy]. The key findings obtained are as follows. Firstly, we have found no machine maintenance operations where the risk of worker overexposure is considered significantly large that immediate design attention is needed. Secondly, the most significant risk of worker overexposure is due to airborne releases of radioactivity from cooling water pipes and tubes that may not have been fully drained and dried, when they are cut, or inadvertently opened, by workers (frequency of pipe-cutting activities could be significantly high). Thirdly, the risk of overexposure from human error could also be significant. This varies from mistaking the machine sector, to mistaking the component to be maintained. This is analogous to working on a live electrical circuit, when it is believed to be dead (disconnected from the power source) because the worker has mistakenly selected the wrong circuit-a look-alike one. Similarly, consider the situation of a worker mistakenly preparing to work on a cooling water circuit that is still at pressure and temperature, instead of the one that has been drained and dried. The more look-alike situations there are in the facility, the greater the probability of committing this type of error. Fourthly, when consideration is given to human error, we believe that the aggregation of different diagnostics in the same port enhances the probability of human error. At the moment, these risks cannot be quantified. The task of quantifying those risks in the future should be considered. Finally, the transport of activated in-vessel components, including components of plasma-heating and current-drive systems, in non-shielded casks, could carry with it a significant risk of worker overexposure. In the context of ALARA, this approach requires a specific study to justify its use. Concluding, it is important to note that by having identified the possibility of an overexposure situation does not mean that it is probable. The calculation of probability awaits further studies of this nature, when the design reaches a more detailed level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

One of the fundamental challenges is the integration of ports in the vacuum vessel. The lower port of the DEMO machine is particularly challenging due to tight space constraints imposed by the toroidal field (TF) coils and the requirement to provide a large open duct through both the divertor and inside the port to enable for vacuum pumping. In addition, feeding pipes of divertor and tritium breeding blanket need to be integrated and access space must be provided for various remote handling operations. Several neutronics requirements need to be fulfilled, e.g. the nuclear heating of the superconducting TF coils and the gamma radiation levels inside the cryostat need to be limited to reduce occupational exposure to personnel during maintenance, and the irradiation damage and neutron heating in different components need to be considered in the design and limited. The results of neutronic analyses show that further shielding optimization is needed as maximum TF coil heating is still 5× the design limit and the SDDR values orders of magnitude above the target values inside the lower port duct. With this in mind the direction of future design developments is discussed. © 2020",SYS,DEMO,IN-VESSEL,2020,DEMO; Lower port; Material damage; Nuclear heating; Port integration,Breeding blankets; Ducts; Heating; Materials handling; Power plants; Remote control; Shielding; Superconducting coils; DEMO; Gamma radiation level; Lower port; Material damages; Nuclear heating; Occupational exposure; Shielding optimizations; Tritium breeding blanket; Neutron irradiation,"Euratom research and training programme 2014-2018; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (633053)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081685975

For access, multiple coolant pipes need to be removed. As an option to reduce downtime and increase maintenance speed, a so-called mechanical multi-pipe connection (MPC) concept is developed to allow removal of multiple pipes at the same time using remotely operated mechanical connections. MPC is one promising candidate to allow fast remotely controlled opening and closing of multiple pipe connections by using flanges and bolts. Some major challenges for the application of MPC are highly constrained space on top of the BBs, accessibility for appropriate tools and homogenous distribution of sealing forces on the gaskets. Numerous studies on arrangement and force application methods were performed to identify suitable concepts – of which a compact flange design using direct bolted connection is favourable. Finite Element Analyses on the shape and geometry optimization of the MPC led to analytically verified solutions. Furthermore, material selection and behaviour under radiation, vacuum, and thermal cycling at high temperature conditions requires advancement of available material treatment solutions in terms of things such as coated surfaces of threads and contact areas on flanges to avoid diffusion bonding. © 2024",SYS,DEMO,CRYO,2024,Demo; Mechanical pipe connection (MPC); Remote maintenance,Breeding blankets; Fasteners; Maintenance; Applicability study; Constrained space; Coolant pipes; Demo; Maintenance concepts; Mechanical; Mechanical connections; Mechanical pipe connection; Plasma-facing components; Remote maintenance; Flanges,"European Commission, EC, (101052200 — EUROfusion)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187791237

The CMM is designed to place/remove the divertor cassettes which are near the RH ports into/from the vessel; the CTM is, instead, designed to move the cassettes which are distant from an RH port inside the vessel toroidally. To date, CMM is under a more advanced development stage of design with respect to CTM. This article describes and illustrates in detail the virtual kinematic simulations of the CMM operative procedures. With regard to the CTM, only preliminary simulations are presented. These activities are part of the integration and verification stages of the CMM design process, carried out in a Systems Engineering approach and following the workflow prescribed by the V-model and its requirements, functions, logical, and physical architecture (RFLP) paradigm. Therefore, after an introduction to the CMM requirements, functions, and conceptual design, which have already been developed, the article focuses on the description of its virtual kinematic simulations and the analysis of their results, with the aim of verifying the feasibility of the handling procedures and the correct integration of the CMM in the surrounding environment, considering all the in-vessel geometric constraints. The simulations have been carried out following a forward-kinematics approach. Therefore, each simulation has been divided into a series of consecutive activities, assigning each of them a set of values for the five CMM joints able to reach the required final position of the end-effector. The software DELMIA, part of the Dassault Syst&#x00E8;mes V5 platform which also includes the software for CAD modeling CATIA V5, has been used to perform the simulations. As for the CTM operation, since its concept design has not been completed yet, preliminary virtual kinematic simulations have been performed with a different goal: to evaluate alternative possible operative strategies, which can impact the device design.

The maintenance of the Cassettes requires their periodic removal and replacement by remote handling tools. The remote handling connector (RHC) of the DOI includes electrical and optical connections for the instrumentation cables, which must be disconnected during maintenance. The available space for the DOI RHC design is limited and the environmental conditions inside the Vacuum Vessel include high vacuum 10^-5 Pa, high temperature up to 350 °C and neutron and gamma-ray irradiation up to 1 GGy by the end of ITER operation. The access of remote handling tools is limited in the operating space surrounding DOI RHC. A study of existing connectors designed for plasma diagnostics electrical cables indicated that the concepts could not be adapted as such for the DOI RHC. The main concerns were related to the increased limitation of space, and the need to incorporate optical contacts for the fiber-optic cables that should be aligned with high precision to minimize optical losses. A dedicated design was required and developed. A novel extending DOI RHC concept was selected as it minimizes the required design changes to the surrounding systems. The concept consists of a cassette socket with an extending link located on the Divertor Cassette and a permanently installed vacuum vessel socket. The concept relies on the actuation of linear motion by the bolting tools of Cassette Toroidal Mover (CTM) manipulator and the flexibility of the cabling during the actuation. A physical full-size mock-up of the DOI RHC was manufactured to test the design solutions. The functionality of the mechanical structure in regards to remote handling operations were tested at remote handling connector platform (RHCP) at VTT Tampere Finland. Suppliers of optical connectors and ferrules were contacted to discuss the requirements of DOI RHC and commercial off-the-shelf optical components. Since there is no commercially available solution for attaching the fiber to the ferrule which would meet the aforementioned requirements, initial soldering tests were performed. The developed DOI RHC design provides input to the following design phases. © 2023",HARD,ITER,DIVERTOR,2023,Divertor; ITER; Operational instrumentation; Optics; Remote handling; Remote handling connector,Cables; Gamma rays; Remote control; Connector design; Divertor; Divertor cassette; Handling tools; ITER; ITER divertor; Operational instrumentation; Remote handling; Remote handling connector; Plasma diagnostics,"VTT Technical Research Center of Finland Ltd, (IO/19/CT/4300001985)",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152224734

A more detailed assessment of the proposed schemes was required. The development of remote maintenance concepts for DEMO and future fusion power plants is driven by a couple of key requirements to maximize the overall plant availability. That includes heading for feasibility and high reliability of the plant maintenance system. This work is particularly important within the PPPT work programme as novel maintenance concepts must be developed and validated for use in DEMO. Thus one of the objectives for the European Fusion Development Agreement in Power Plant Physics and Technology (EFDA PPPT) 2012 work programme was to establish an initial set of system requirements that the DEMO fusion power plant will place on its Remote Maintenance System (RMS). Based on a preliminary DEMO model, developers of Remote Handling Equipment (RHE) should be provided with a set of comprehensive available information about the working area of RHE for in-vessel and ex-vessel maintenance. The task was not dedicated to repeat a row of top level requirements but to give technical information about different items. Work progress and results are shown in this paper. Being in a pre-conceptual phase, one of the results was that at present there are only few 'real' requirements but lots of assumptions. All information was collected, further investigated and brought out as a valuable set of primary boundary conditions for the RHE developers. © 2013 IEEE.",ASSESS,DEMO,(general/none),2013,compilation; DEMO; logistics; remote maintenance; requirement,Fusion reactions; Logistics; Power plants; compilation; DEMO; DEMO (demonstration power plant); European fusion development agreements; Remote maintenance; Remote maintenance system; requirement; Technology development; Maintenance,,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84890469343

There are neutron diagnostics measuring the neutrons within the VV that need to be calibrated during initial assembly and operation phases that require remote handling of a neutron generator. This paper describes the design and analysis of the transporter of an in-vessel RH system called “Agile Robot Transporter (ART)” that is devised to handle a neutron calibration source and a dual arm manipulator. Its design is focused on agility to have better operational efficiency by reducing the number of port opening, less deployment/removal/operational time, efficient tool change, modular design for easy maintenance and decontamination. The design methodology is described starting from initial design, selection of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components, identification of bespoke components, and iterative processes including mechanical design and analysis. Mechanical design is conducted based on the selected components while respecting the space constraints of the system itself and interfacing systems. The mechanical design includes cabling for the actuators and sensors, means for contamination protection, and modular design for maintenance. Iterative multi-body dynamic analyses by using the MATLAB/Simscape/Multibody and finite element analyses (FEA) by using ANSYS are carried out to find a feasible design solution. Maintainability assessment is conducted by showing the disassembly process. © 2024 ITER",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,2024,ITER; Maintainability; Remote handling; Tokamak,Iterative methods; Machine design; Manipulators; Materials handling; Neutron sources; Neutrons; Remote control; Agile robots; Design and analysis; ITER; ITER tokamak; Mechanical design; Modular designs; Radiation levels; Remote handling; Tokamak; Vacuum vessel; Maintenance,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192148710

When combining PWM with motors and long cables, such as the ones that will be found at ITER, the standing waves originated are potentially very harmful for both actuator's life span and control performance. Several methods have been investigated to cope with this issue, such as the use of chokes, filters, snubbers or active modification of the PWM signal. Of all possible locations where an electrical servo-motor could be used at ITER, the most critical scenario arises when mounting a low power motor, with a low gear ratio, in a dexterous manipulator for bilateral teleoperation. In those circumstances cable lengths of more than 150 m are expected between manipulator and control cubicle. In this paper, the effects of long cables in the system safety are analysed on a custom made test bench. The most common solutions to cope with this issue are analysed and a commercial LC filter is selected for further experimentation. An extensive set of experiments are carried out in order to validate the proposed solution for being used on remote handling equipment at ITER. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Applying maintenance requirements to this system has resulted in significant improvements in component accessibility. Further changes currently under review could result in a reduction in vacuum duct length, the addition of duct shielding to reduce neutron activation, a pump and valve assembly which can be serviced from the floor rather than solely from a crane, and provision for transport cacks to enter the pump room through an equipment airlock, large enough to permit the entry of robotic devices as well as construction equipment. This rearrangement could offers savings in overall height of the pump and valve assembly. An innovation in valve configuration will allow for on-line removal of the large vacuum valve seal discs without loss of vacuum.

The most important operation for the BRHS is the two-year maintenance campaign in which all 440 FWs must be replaced. The in-vessel components will have been activated by neutrons produced by the D-T reaction, with the total dose estimated to be 5 MGy. Moreover, activated dust will have accumulated in the VV and will contaminate the BRHS. The BRHS must first be transported to the red zone of the hot cell facility where it will be decontaminated remotely. The BRHS will then be transported to the hands-on area to be decontaminated manually and undergo maintenance. The ITER Organization has defined the dose rate criteria in the hands-on area as 100 μSv/h, thus, decontamination and maintenance activities must be performed in compliance with these criteria.

The maintenance configuration considered here is the Vertical Remote Handling, meaning gravity acting along the launcher radial axis. The plant, where the maintenance under consideration is occurring, is the Hot Cell Facility Work Cell. The study here reported has been carried out within the presently ongoing EFDA Goal Oriented Training program on Remote Handling (GOT-RH), which aims to support ITER activities. This document and its contents have to be considered as part of a more vast RAMI analysis to be developed within the GOT-RH, which aims to maximize the Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive system availability. The Baseline CAD model of the Electron Cyclotron Heating and Current Drive Upper Launcher is currently in its preliminary design phase and does not provide enough details for developing a fully detailed maintenance strategy. Therefore, through a System Engineering approach, a set of assumptions was conceived on the launcher structure, as a basis for development of a Remote Handling strategy. Moreover, to compare different design solutions related to the possibility of integrating a quasi-optical component into the Blanket Shield Module, a Trade-Off was made, and its contents are shown here. The outcome of this System Engineering approach has been formalized into Task Definition Forms whose contents are reported here. The Remote Handling strategy presented in this work will be tested in the near future both through Virtual Reality simulations and through prototype experiments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",STRAT,ITER,RF-HCD,2013,Electron Cyclotron Upper Launcher; ITER; Nuclear fusion; Remote Handling,Computer aided design; Electric shielding; Fusion reactions; Launching; Maintenance; Materials handling; Plasma heating; Systems engineering; Electron cyclotron heating; Electron cyclotrons; ITER; Nuclear fusion; Plasma-facing components; Preliminary design phase; Remote handling; Virtual reality simulations; Remote control,"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT",,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884986400

Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a shared autonomous scheme that intervenes in the operator's command input when necessary, autonomously ensuring the safe operation of the manipulator by employing a rolling horizon planning controller based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). This controller considers the motion boundaries and collision avoidance constraints of the manipulator, accompanied by the design of corresponding objective functions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct tests on collision-free trajectory tracking and comprehensive performance with collision constraints, confirming the feasibility and excellent performance of the approach. © 2024 Korean Nuclear Society",SOFT AUTO,CFETR,(general/none),2024,Bilateral teleoperation; CFETR; CMOR; NMPC; Remote handling; Shared autonomy,,"Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology Program of China, (2018-000052-73-01-001228); CPSF, (GZC20232717, YZJJ2024QN17)",Korean Nuclear Society,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85197041556

This work aims to disclose the preliminary consideration for the design of a robotic system intended to handle pipes that must be periodically substituted in port 4 of the vacuum vessel. As the port appears as a narrow duct with a trapezoidal section, the arm must satisfy strict requirements in term of incumbrance and, at the same time, it must ensure the capability to remove and reposition the pipes which are displaced al around the perimeter of the section. The configuration is analyzed considering the geometrical constraints and the requirements for the workspace.

The applications and structures of the upper, equatorial, and LPs are different between those of ITER and DEMO. In DEMO, the breeding blankets (BBs) could be removed from the UP, a multipurpose deployer is transported and installed in the EP, and the divertor is maintained through the LP. It is noted that during remote maintenance (RM), the operating environment must be safe for the operators. To achieve this goal, reliable RM tools and RM strategies must be designed and developed. One of the containment barriers of the tokamak is the port closure plates (PCPs), which weighs between 1.3 and 25 tons depends on its location, and the PCPs need to be removed during the maintenance process. Therefore, in this article, the current designs of the PCPs are first presented. Then, the RM tools in both commercial and research stages are studied for the RM of the PCPs. Next, the RM strategies are designed and developed for each port. Finally, suggestions for the development of different RM tools are proposed.

This paper describes the remote maintenance sequences of the caesium ovens and the Beam Source (BS) of the ITER HNB by using the Neutral Beam Remote Handling System (NBRHS). Caesium oven maintenance is a regular maintenance that needs to be performed every Long-Term Maintenance (LTM) period as caesium is a consumable to produce caesium vapor to enhance negative ion production. The BS maintenance is a corrective maintenance to do if it fails during the lifetime of ITER. Maintenance of the caesium ovens and the BS involves many RH operations that require collaboration of the NBRHS subsystems and RH tools. Moreover, the maintenance operation needs to be done without spreading contamination from the HNB vessel to the NB cell. The developed maintenance scenario relies on the current NB cell environment and the existing interfaces in the plant system. © 2023",STRAT ,ITER,NBI,2023,Beam source; Caesium oven; Heating neutral beam system; ITER; Remote handling; Tokamak,Cytology; Maintenance; Materials handling; Negative ions; Ovens; Remote control; Beam sources; Beam system; Cesium oven; Heating neutral beam system; ITER; Maintenance scenario; Neutral beams; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Tokamak; Cells,,Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174179950

The authors discuss the design criteria for the divertor mounting structure and identify the mechanical design issues that need to be addressed. Achieving the criteria may require the development of new components and innovative configurations, specifically a new class of remote fasteners and electrically resistant material for mounts. The possible design of such components and an R and D program to develop them are described, and issues specific to the high-aspect-ratio design (HARD) configuration are summarized.

Therefore to achieve a sufficient length of operational time inside future fusion power plants, a suitable radiation tolerant RHE for maintenance operations in radiation environments is inevitably required. To assess the influence of the radiation on remote handling equipment (RHE), an investigation about radiation hardness assessment of typically used RHE components, has been performed. Additionally, information about the absorbed total dose that every component can withstand before failure was collected. Furthermore, the development of a zonal applicability tool for supporting RHE designers has been started using Excel VBA. The tool connects the data from the radiation field analysis (3-D radiation map) to the radiation hardness data of the planned RHE for DEMO remote maintenance. The intelligent combination of the available information for the radiation behaviour and radiation level at certain time and certain location may help with the taking of decisions about the application of RHE in radiation environment. The user inputs the following parameters: the specific device used in the RHE, the planned location and the maintenance period. The output is the expected lifetime of the selected RHE component at the given location and maintenance period. Planned action times have to be also considered. After having all the parameters it can be decided, if specific RHE will survive the duration of the maintenance operation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this case, long articulated arm usually shows flexible beam relative disturbance and deformation. In this paper, the deformation of movement decreases along with the yaw joint angle decreasing, taking account into the sensor accuracy, it is eligible to treat the deformation linear. Fingerprint is a traditional manner to solve deformation assignment problem. Multiple regression analysis methods are assigned to estimate robot flexibility deformation, after the evaluation of test output, the excellent result is adopted to overcome the static deformation error. The advanced method guarantees generality, particularity, accuracy and prediction speed. The result could be improved by increasing the sample data or making partial static model could have further improvement.  © 2022 IEEE.",SOFT,EAST,IN-VESSEL,2022,deformation; estimation; Information analysis; machine learning; robot,Combinatorial optimization; Flexible structures; Information analysis; Intelligent robots; Intelligent systems; Machine learning; Assignment problems; Flexible beam; Flexible deformation; Joint angle; Machine-learning; Regression algorithms; Regression estimation; Remote handling; Sensor accuracy; Sensor fusion; Regression analysis,"National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (11802305); Young Scientists Fund",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152398535

To prevent damage, the antennas need to be removed/(re)installed by remote handling (RH) means before/after the removal/reinstallation of the blanket shield modules just above and below them. The RH operations shall be performed by the Blanket Remote Handling System (BRHS), [1], and require a tool not yet available in the ITER Remote Maintenance System. Herein, we describe a conceptual design of this tool that considers guidance and security to overcome some of the identified RH issues. The RH tool is designed to remove and (re)install the antenna in a single step using the translation and rotation capabilities of the BRHS (or a dual-arm manipulator attached to the BRHS) to bolt/unbolt the antenna to/from the support without extra operations. The RH tool is also designed to minimize the space required to operate between the blanket shield modules. However, the guidance pins of the tool are dimensioned according to the maximum positioning error allowed for the BRHS with a diagonal shape to guide the tool along the antenna. The design is implemented using pop-up fasteners and standard sizes authorised by the ITER Organization. A set of mechanical benchmarks are presented based on the CAD model of the tool. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.",HARD,ITER,RF-HCD,2019,"Nuclear instruments and methods for hot plasma diagnostics; Overall mechanics design (support structures and materials, vibration analysis etc); Plasma diagnostics - probes",Antennas; Conceptual design; Electric shielding; Experimental reactors; Materials handling; Plasma diagnostics; Reflection; Reflectometers; Remote control; Tokamak devices; Vibration analysis; Blanket-shield modules; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Nuclear instruments; Plasma positions; Positioning error; Remote handling system; Remote maintenance system; Support structures; Computer aided design,"Fusion for Energy, F4E, (F4E-FPA-375-SG04); Instituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia para Excitotoxicidade e Neuroproteção, INCT-EN, (UID/FIS/50010/2019)",Institute of Physics Publishing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072223788

The study presented here deals with design options and Remote Handling issues related to the waveguide assembly, an ensemble of mm-wave transmission line components mounted on a vacuum flange. This flange is part of the primary vacuum boundary of the ITER vessel. This paper describes the preliminary assessment of the RH compatibility of the sub-assembly, and a conceptual description of the maintenance actions to be performed on it. A comparison between two possible configurations for the tapers is reported: a waveguide integrated design, in which tapers are integral part of the in-plug waveguide, and an auxiliary shield integrated design, in which the tapers are integrated into the Auxiliary Shield. An important aspect in the design is to ensure the Remote Handling compatibility. Due to lack of space and limited dexterity of the slave manipulator, the general approach in defining the maintenance strategy is to avoid breaking the interfaces of the different components of the assembly, and to extract it from the Upper Port Plug as a single entity. An assessment on possible replacement procedure and the required tools are presented here. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",SYS,ITER,RF-HCD,2014,ECRH; ITER; Nuclear fusion; Remote Handling,Flanges; Materials handling; Remote control; Waveguides; ECRH; Electron cyclotron heating; ITER; Maintenance strategies; Nuclear fusion; Preliminary assessment; Remote handling; Replacement procedures; Design,"Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, KIT",Elsevier Ltd,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905986756

Any replacement of a BB segment shall be performed by Remote Handling Equipment (RHE) through the vertical upper port: any active action is executed by RHE that clamps a BB segment in the upper portion using a BB transporter. A driving requirement of DEMO commercial technology for RHE is the maximum operating temperature at the BB-RHE interface during BB replacement: the objective of this study is properly to assess this limit, being now the allowable value at 100 °C. This study deals with the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) concept. The initial configuration, with all sector segments (three in the outboard region and two in the inboard one) in their nominal position, has been considered; then the Finite Element model predicts if a natural convection cooling air flux inside vacuum vessel is adequate or if it is necessary a forced convection cooling system. The decay heat produced by the main blanket components (the BB modules caps and lateral walls, the backwalls, the supporting structures, the backplate manifolds, and so on) have been evaluated beforehand: the values applied as body loads in the thermal analyses have been selected within the set related to one month after shut-down. With the assumed geometrical and physical boundary conditions set for the natural and forced convection, the analyses indicate that a forced convection should be necessary to ensure compliance with the present RHE requirements.

This paper describes the results and experience gathered during this activity. Replacement of a neutral beam ion source was chosen for mock-up for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is expected that the task will be required to be done during the D-T phase and secondly it includes a comprehensive sample of the remote operations expected in the ex-vessel tasks. Tasks such as operation of fasteners, electrical power and control connectors, quick release fluid couplings, lip weld flange cutting and welding, special lifting and alignment fixtures and both manual and powered tools. Included within this work are operations with high levels of difficulty due to very limited access and viewing constraints.

Two important maintenance requirements for ITER are a device that is fully remotely maintainable, with the provision for hands-on maintenance wherever possible, and the ability to maintain components with short lives or high failure rates without moving other components or disturbing the machine's internal or external environment. Some of the maintenance tasks are accomplished through the use of specialized remote maintenance equipment that will perform crucial in-vesscl and ex-vessel operations. In-vessel maintenance will be performed with a combination of horizontal and vertical access. Since the completion of the Conceptual Design Activity (CDA), systems studies by the U.S. ITER design team have pointed to the possible benefits of a high aspect ratio design (HARD). The alternative HARD has been shown to have better performance characteristics than the present baseline. The HARD machine configuration modified in size a number of major components that must be remotely maintained or replaced. This required re- evaluation of the maintenance scenarios of these components with respect to changes in physical accessibility, assembly and disassembly, and remote maintenance equipment. The CDA baseline design and HARD are compared from an assembly and maintenance feasibility perspective for some critical operations. © 1991 IEEE.",SYS ASSESS,ITER,(general/none),1991,,Aspect ratio; Conceptual design; Failure analysis; Machine components; Maintenance; Tokamak devices; Conceptual design activity; Critical operations; External environments; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Maintenance designs; Maintenance requirement; Maintenance scenario; Performance characteristics; Experimental reactors,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067658457

The valves must comply with specifications for leak-tightness, radiation resistance, dust tolerance, overpressure, and thermal gradients. Remote maintenance of the seal and valve moving parts without disturbance to the rest of the valve system is a requirement. The authors describe two methods of seal exchange by remote means. In the first method, a flask is proposed for the valve moving parts exchange in inert gas, when the machine is shut down. In the second method a novel concept is described for seal exchange while under vacuum, without having to bring the machine up to atmosphere. The advantages of this method are that scheduled remote handling operations and outages for seal replacement are not required. Also, the need for a flask is avoided. © 1991 IEEE.",HARD,ITER,IN-VESSEL,1991,,Bottles; Inert gases; Tokamak devices; Vacuum pumps; International thermonuclear experimental reactor; Isolation valves; Large diameter; Leak tightness; Radiation resistance; Remote handling; Remote maintenance; Vacuum pumping system; Experimental reactors,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067657802

For the former a software tool has been developed to handle the large amount of data processed and to allow user friendly updating of data as design or maintenance procedures evolves, and, know-how on maintenance activities improves. A systematic approach was adopted to evaluate work efforts (WE) needed to execute specific tasks. The so-called ""elementary works"" were identified and classified and the time required to perform the operation and involved people were estimated. The elementary works were then aggregated in the so-called main operations (e.g. window replacement, pipe removal, etc.). For each of them, on the base of expected maintenance frequency and dose rate fields, total WE and worker doses were calculated. It was assessed that hands-on activities in the Equatorial Port No. 1 require 472 person h of WE leading to a collective dose of ∼7.4 person mSv/year. The most critical operation in terms of worker doses is the sealing/unsealing of port plug, which weights for about the 23% of the total. The second ORE assessment was related to the management of ITER operational radioactive wastes. These wastes include streams originated in the plant from the experimental and maintenance activities, with exclusion of those generated inside the Tokamak that will be highly activated and will be managed inside the Hot Cell Processing System. The estimated collective annual dose related to the Waste Treatment System ranges between ∼4.3 and ∼4.9 person mSv. The two values depend on the assumptions made for the exposure levels in the operative areas. Both studies have to be considered as preliminary as far as the results are concerned due to the quite rough input data (on dose rates and design details), while the approach might be considered sound and up to date. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In DEMO reactor design important considerations are the reactor availability and reliable maintenance operations. The proposed divertor mover is a hydraulic telescopic boom driven from the transportation cask through the maintenance tunnel of the reactor. The boom is divided in three sections and it is driving an end-effector in order to perform the scheduled operations of maintenance inside the vacuum vessel. Two alternative designs of the end effector to grip and manipulate the divertor cassette are presented in this work. Both concepts are hydraulically actuated, based on ITER previous studies. The divertor cassette end-effector consists of a lifting arm linked to the divertor mover, a tilting plate, a cantilever arm and a hook-plate. Taking advantage of the ITER RH background and experience, the proposed hydraulic RH system is compared with the rack and pinion system currently designed for ITER and is an object of simulations at Divertor Test Platform (DTP2) in VTT's Labs of Tampere, Finland. Pros and cons will be put in evidence. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

During the maintenance operations some shielding barrier has to be partly or completely removed and workers are likely to be exposed to an unusual radiological dose. In the present work the Occupational Radiation Exposure (ORE) for the maintenance activities performed at the PHTS has been assessed. The problem of the activated corrosion product (ACP) transport assessment inside the coolant has been faced and solved with the computer code PACTOLE. The working procedure protocols have been taken from the fission PWR plant experience. The shielding effectiveness of the PHTS components has been evaluated with a well tested computer code.

Modifications to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory baseline, the next step (TNS), which led to significant improvements in device maintainability, are discussed. These modifications are: a reduction in the number of toroidal field coils used and an increase in coil size, a rearrangement of poloidal field coils to preclude the need for coil dismantling during a torus sector replacement, and use of a secondary vacuum enclosure. Various types of secondary enclosures are discussed and the rationale for selecting a vacuum building approach is given.",SYS,(none),(general/none),1979,,REMOTE MAINTENANCE; Tokamak devices,,ANS,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0018322162
